    "title": "Potential systemic risk: OP_RETURN outputs as unintended governance signaling",
    "body": "## Context\nIn `policy/policy.cpp`, inside `IsStandardTx`, OP_RETURN (NULL_DATA) outputs are limited in size (`nMaxDatacarrierBytes`, default 80 bytes). This effectively prevents arbitrarily large payloads but does not fully eliminate systemic risks from structured misuse.\n\n## Description of risk\nEven within the allowed size, OP_RETURN can be systematically repurposed as a signaling channel. For example:\n- Each UTXO could embed a short marker in its OP_RETURN.\n- These markers could be aggregated and interpreted as \"votes,\" weighted by UTXO value.\n- Such schemes open the door to unintended governance mechanisms, plutocratic signaling, or coordinated coercion.\n\n## Why this matters\nBitcoin’s governance model relies on *implicit consensus* (full-node validation, miner incentives, market dynamics), not *explicit on-chain signaling*.  \nIf OP_RETURN becomes a de facto signaling layer, it could:\n- Create social pressure to treat such outputs as binding \"votes.\"\n- Enable plutocratic influence proportional to coin holdings.\n- Incentivize coordination games or mempool spam outside Bitcoin’s intended scope.\n\n## Discussion\nThere is likely no definitive technical fix: stricter byte limits or per-tx rules can be easily circumvented.  \nThe more realistic risk is narrative: if OP_RETURN signaling is tolerated or left unaddressed, it may gain unintended legitimacy over time.  \n\n---\nThis is not a bug report but a design consideration. Input from maintainers on how to frame OP_RETURN’s role to avoid misinterpretation or misuse in the near future would be appreciated.\n",

      "body": "The same things can be done without OP_RETURN. Even if you have P2PK-only, old, plain, ECDSA signatures, then still: they can commit to arbitrary data, through their R-values.\n\n> Each UTXO could embed a short marker in its OP_RETURN.\n\nNot only in OP_RETURN. Since miners started accepting out-of-band transactions, then different transaction versions can be used to signal things, just like they are used during soft-forks, to check, how many miners are ready to support some BIP.\n\n> These markers could be aggregated and interpreted as \"votes,\" weighted by UTXO value.\n\nEven if we talk about standard transactions, then still: they can be mined. And there are some altcoins, using that kind of schemes, for example: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5535410\n\nAnd then, you can see transactions like that on-chain: https://mempool.space/tx/000000000fdf0c619cd8e0d512c7e2c0da5a5808e60f12f1e0d01522d2986a51\n\n> Incentivize coordination games or mempool spam outside Bitcoin’s intended scope.\n\nFor example sidechains? See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5552091.0\n\nCoordination games were always possible, since 2009. To stop them, it would require banning OP_SIZE, and blocking all ways of mining things, including vanity addresses, and stuff like that. I think the problem mentioned in the title is unavoidable, and now, the only thing to discuss is: how to deal with it?",

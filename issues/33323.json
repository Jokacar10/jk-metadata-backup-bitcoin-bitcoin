    "title": "Potential systemic risk: OP_RETURN outputs as unintended governance signaling",
    "body": "## Context\nIn `policy/policy.cpp`, inside `IsStandardTx`, OP_RETURN (NULL_DATA) outputs are limited in size (`nMaxDatacarrierBytes`, default 80 bytes). This effectively prevents arbitrarily large payloads but does not fully eliminate systemic risks from structured misuse.\n\n## Description of risk\nEven within the allowed size, OP_RETURN can be systematically repurposed as a signaling channel. For example:\n- Each UTXO could embed a short marker in its OP_RETURN.\n- These markers could be aggregated and interpreted as \"votes,\" weighted by UTXO value.\n- Such schemes open the door to unintended governance mechanisms, plutocratic signaling, or coordinated coercion.\n\n## Why this matters\nBitcoin’s governance model relies on *implicit consensus* (full-node validation, miner incentives, market dynamics), not *explicit on-chain signaling*.  \nIf OP_RETURN becomes a de facto signaling layer, it could:\n- Create social pressure to treat such outputs as binding \"votes.\"\n- Enable plutocratic influence proportional to coin holdings.\n- Incentivize coordination games or mempool spam outside Bitcoin’s intended scope.\n\n## Discussion\nThere is likely no definitive technical fix: stricter byte limits or per-tx rules can be easily circumvented.  \nThe more realistic risk is narrative: if OP_RETURN signaling is tolerated or left unaddressed, it may gain unintended legitimacy over time.  \n\n---\nThis is not a bug report but a design consideration. Input from maintainers on how to frame OP_RETURN’s role to avoid misinterpretation or misuse in the near future would be appreciated.\n",

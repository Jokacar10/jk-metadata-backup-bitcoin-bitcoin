    "title": "Acccedence; Double Poisson Sum†; p 0.04999579029644097",
    "body": "Dear Bitcoin,\n\n Wouldn't it Is the Poisson Sum shown as the periodic end or the spearhead in Bitcoin? Because it is not at all applicable to either Blockchain or what we call Cryptocurrency. Either you can really implement what the Poisson Sum is or you just have Delusions that think you understand what Satoshi Nakamoto published.\n\n Why is it hurt by the content of my message? Let's focus on the topic ^^.\n\nWe know that the Poisson Sum has an exponential value of rational repeating but one thing that is missing is that mathematics like this is not applicable to the X stipulation in the Blockchain even though we cannot change it but it does not get better because the Poisson Sum with a show of Z value 1 and 0.3 and 0.1 does not seem to have any reference for Programmers to take advantage of this.\n\nI introduce the Double Poisson Sum Dagger and how does it's work? 1.96 and 1.96.\n\nFirst, We must undo the primitive error in Genesis Block.\nSecond, We must be obliged to create a unanimous decision with K = Tx/10 Minutes on Hashrate Criteria ( 0,39 †) + num 1400 with Block A and B.\nThird, We are doing this with the goal that the Double Poisson Sum Dagger is ready for Acccedence A.K.A change in dynamics that I can consider the threat of Positivism Falsehood and Devil Byzantium.\n\nFunction Compute_K_Double_Poisson(Tx, Block_A, Block_B):\n    Time_in_Minutes = Tx / 10  \n    Hashrate_Factor = 0.39  \n    K = (Time_in_Minutes * Hashrate_Factor) + 1400  \n\n    Poisson_A = Poisson_Distribution(Block_A)  \n    Poisson_B = Poisson_Distribution(Block_B)  \n\n    K_Adjusted = K + (Poisson_A + Poisson_B) * 5.50\n    Return K_Adjusted  \n\nFunction Poisson_Distribution(lambda):\n    Random_Variable = Poisson(lambda)  \n    Return Random_Variable\n\nSo what is the problem that Bitcoin solves by implementing the Double Poisson Sum†? The problem solved is periodic and average real-time calculations with numbers that are not too excessive and not lacking, In terms of cost, energy and Exahash, we get justice.\n\nSyllogistic Logic on Double Poisson Sum Dagger.\n\n1. M-P | M-S | S-P → Could represent stages in num 1400 on Double Lambda Criteria.\n\nM (Middle Term) → Tx+10 Minutes on going.\n\nP (Predicate) → Validation outcome (Grouped blocks).\n\nS (Subject) → Transaction in process.\n\nThus, transaction validation can be explained using syllogistic structure!\n\n\n\n2. A-I-I, E-A-O, I-A-I.\n\nCould represent different possible transaction results, depending on the validation calculated in the PoW system.\n\nExample:\n\nA-I-I: All transactions meet a certain proof of work → Some transactions are validated.\n\nE-A-O: Block is not eligible → No Block filling.\n\nI-A-I: Some transactions meet the proof of work → Some transactions are accepted.\n\nA-I-I: All Double Poisson Sum† Adjust the criteria 1.96 → Done to validation with Blockchain.\n\nE-A-O: If num running 1400 but Hashrate less than 0,39 → Transaction will be pending 10*6 / 60 Minutes as a Consequence.\n\nI-A-I: Sender complete the validation process before it gets to the Receiver → Your Bitcoin it's completed.\n\nFinal Result: Pseudonym¹ run validation before the Bitcoin he is dragged to the Chain → Pseudonym¹ must make 1.96 of the result of the K value → K value is the earliest value of the form of Grouped Blocks → From 1.96 to 0.04999579029644097 → If Pseudonym¹ wants to transfer Bitcoin to Pseudonym²If Pseudonym¹ wants to transfer Bitcoin to Pseudonym² → Both must have the same Hashrate, the same Num and the Double Poisson Sum Dagger of the Bit energy validation is ready → Has been Successfully.\n\nz = 1.96\np = 0.04999579029644097.\n\nBy Expressist Philosophia, You and I will see in the future where Bitcoin does not need to be changed from any side just because your hand wants more sessions in Bitcoin, the Double Poisson Sum Dagger with a count of 1.96 creates a stipulation that Miners are doing better and are no longer structural, We can calculating the probability at 5% but because the Hashrate and Num groups I have adjusted so that the probability of mining difficulties remains with the distance of health of our age and our children, grandchildren in the future... Miners are also made easier to mine on the condition that I mentioned and anyone can more than Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin Amount due to the difference in reward and realistic Poisson Distribution makes this completely unfair because Block and Chain still work despite the significant difference in Bit energy.",

    "title": "Sparrow Wallet Version 1.8.4 and Bitcoin Core: Issues Connecting",
    "body": "I was previously running Sparrow Wallet Version 1.8.2 with my Bitcoin Coin node on my MacBook Pro M1 notebook. Sparrow was connecting to the Node without any issues and within around 30 seconds.  Yesterday I dowloaded and verified the latest version of Sparrow 1.8.4 and installed it after taking all verification steps.  However, the Sparrow Wallet keeps timing out after a few minutes and will not connect to my Node.  I've tried this multiple times and get the same result.\r\n\r\nIs there an issue with Sparrow Wallet Version 1.8.4, or could there be some other issue at play?  Thanks for your help.  Phil",

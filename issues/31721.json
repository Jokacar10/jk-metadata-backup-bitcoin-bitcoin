      "body": "I think that the following is happening:\n- Orphan is announced to node 1 by a python peer, but it doesn't send the parent tx.\n- submitpackage is executed on node 0, which will sequentially schedule `RelayTransaction`, first for the parent, then for the child.\n- Usually parent and child are put together in one inv, but if the node sends out an inv in between these two `RelayTransaction` calls, the inv for the child may arrive after the tx for the parent was received - since we now only do orphan resolution with announcers after #31397, this means we can't do it right away - we have to wait for the outstanding txrequest with the python peer to time out, ask node0 for the parent again. There is a 60s timeout for this - same as the `sync_mempool` timeout. \n\nThe failure can be reproduced by adding a small sleep in submitpackage after `BroadcastTransaction` (e.g. `1s`) to ensure the parent and child make it into different invs, and also reducing the sync_mempools timeout slightly (e.g. from `60s` to `55s`).  \n\nI'll open a fix.",

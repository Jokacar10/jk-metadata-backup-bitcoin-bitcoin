    "title": "BnB untested/unused condition in UTXO exclusion optimization",
    "body": "If the following condition is remove, no failure occurs:\n`utxo.fee != utxo_pool.at(utxo_pool_index - 1).fee)`\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eb9730ab65887279309af338ad0201924f945ac5/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L177\n\nFurthermore, I believe that this condition isn't actually needed and can be removed, which would slightly boost performance.  The section is checking if a UTXO can be omitted from evaluation if it has the same effective_value as the previous UTXO and the previous was already omitted.  The condition in question is comparing if the fee is different between the previous and the current UTXO.  The only way for the fees to be different is if the effective_value is different, however the previous condition: `utxo.GetSelectionAmount() != utxo_pool.at(utxo_pool_index - 1).GetSelectionAmount()` already compared the effective_values.\n\nPut another way, if one of the conditions is true, the UTXO shortcut can _not_ be applied.  If the effective_values where not the same, then don't do the shortcut except if the fees are the same.  But the only way fees can be different is if the effective_values are different which creates a contradiction.\n\nLastly, I'm struggling to understand what the motivation is to have this condition in the first place.  The condition translates to: If the fee is different between the current UTXO and the previous UTXO, then exclude the current one from the selection shortcut (which as I pointed out would never happen because of the aforementioned contradiction where the effective_value and fee are conditionally dependent).",

Therefore, leaving this condition in has the disadvantage of nullifying the effect of the UTXO optimization performance increase. Earlier I believe I misspoke when I said it was unlikely for effective_value and fee to contradict each other per UTXO, but I believe adding this [parameter](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eb9730ab65887279309af338ad0201924f945ac5/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L177) is unneeded and is likely to worsen performance.",

      "body": "Your reasoning is sound. If you consider that many UTXOs will have equal fees—because they share the same fee rate and weight—then requiring both the effective value and the fee to match before applying the shortcut can indeed be overly strict. In scenarios where the fees are identical but the effective values differ slightly (perhaps due to minor rounding or variation in the UTXO values), the condition\n`utxo.fee != utxo_pool.at(utxo_pool_index - 1).fee`\n\nwill cause the optimization to be bypassed. This means that even if the fee component is effectively the same across UTXOs, any difference in effective value prevents the shortcut from being used, thereby nullifying the potential performance improvement.\n\nRemoving the fee comparison would allow the optimization to trigger based solely on matching effective values. This is particularly attractive if, in practice, the fee rates and weights are uniform enough that fees are almost always equal. Of course, such a change would need thorough testing to ensure that no edge cases are missed where the fee difference might indicate a meaningful divergence between UTXOs.\n\nIn summary, if the vast majority of your UTXOs have equal fees due to identical fee rates and weights, then the fee check can indeed be seen as an unnecessary constraint that prevents the coin selection optimization from being applied, potentially worsening performance.",

      "body": "I did some testing on this issue and I found that if the [parameter](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eb9730ab65887279309af338ad0201924f945ac5/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L177) is removed, one of [tests](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L427) finishes in 3 fewer iterations, from 38 iterations to 35.  The reason the test is more efficient without the added parameter is that there are two UTXOs with the same effective value of `5000000 sats` but different weights and fees:\n\n```\nUTXO A\nvalue: 5000000\nfee: 204\nweight: 272\n\nUTXO B\nvalue: 5000000\nfee: 1200000\nweight: 1600000\n```\n\nDuring the selection, if UTXO A is found to not contribute towards a solution, the algorithm should dismiss UTXO B as also not contributing toward the  solution and skip without an iteration consumed.  However, since the parameter will only skip if the fees are equivalent, the UTXO is instead evaluated and _not_skipped.\n\nA few other observations about this test is that the fee of `UTXO B` is not a practical value because the weight is extreme (1600000).  However, even if the fee and weight are reasonable and different, the same fault would occur during evaluation of the UTXO skip optimization.  Furthermore, this code could also be improved by skipping evaluation of the UTXO if the weight is greater than `max_selection_weight` which it is by far.\n\nLastly, I tried to track down when the [parameter](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eb9730ab65887279309af338ad0201924f945ac5/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L177) was added in hopes of understanding why.  Unfortunately the param was present in the origin PR  [here](\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10637/files#diff-d473ed8396f9451afb848923cfcfaa630c9811a78e07f3ae1ffd3a65da218accR145) by @achow101 without an explanation from what I can tell.  So I'm at a loss to understand why this parameter exists which appears to degrade performance without any added benefit that I can find.\n\nThe recommendations I have to improve the state of the algorithm:\n* Remove the [parameter](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/eb9730ab65887279309af338ad0201924f945ac5/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L177) which is degrading performance in some occasions where two effective values are the same but have different fees\n* Add an iteration count to the API so it can be clearly seen when performance improves or degrades in terms of iteration count\n* Skip evaluating UTXOs that are greater than `max_selection_weight`",

      "body": "> The only way for the fees to be different is if the effective_value is different, however the previous condition: `utxo.GetSelectionAmount() != utxo_pool.at(utxo_pool_index - 1).GetSelectionAmount()` already compared the effective_values.\n\nThis is not accurate. You could have two UTXOs of different output types that have the same effective value but differing fees:\n\nCounterexample:\n\nFeerate: 10 sat/vB\n\nUTXO_1:\n  type: P2WPKH,\n  amount: 10,680 sats\n  input weight: 68 vB\n  **fee: 680 sats**\n  **eff_value: 10,000**\n\nUTXO_2:\n  type: P2TR\n  amount: 10,575 sats\n  input_weight: 57.5 vB\n  **fee: 575 sats**\n  **eff_value: 10,000**\n\nHowever, since [CoinGrinder got merged](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27877/commits/89d09566431f57034d9a7df32547ceb13d79c62c) UTXO sorting tiebreaks by preferring lower waste on equal effective value, so yes, if the first UTXO is skipped combining with a later UTXO will always have worse waste, so I think this optimization is correct. I will doublecheck later.",

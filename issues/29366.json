      "body": "For everyone knowledge, Linux kernel has a separation between software security bugs and hardware ones for good historical reasons. Few years ago, in the handling of Meltdown / Spectre (the 1st gen of transient execution CPU vulnerabilities), early leaks of the issues did happen. Since then, the kernel and OS folks have put in place clearer security handling policy to coordinate vulnerability response, including expelling members from future security incidents who are not respecting embargo deadlines or information contingency policy.\r\n\r\nSee the following except in the Linux embargoed hardware sec documentation:\r\n\r\n> \"The hardware security team will provide the disclosing party a list of developers (domain experts) who should be informed initially about the issue after confirming with the developers that they will adhere to this Memorandum of Understanding and the documented process.\"\r\n\r\nOn the untrustworthiness of the security list - Sadly, yes this is something we should talk about either in public or private (_don’t trust, verify_). As a security researcher and someone who has been working on vulnerability mitigation and disclosure coordination process, in the past I’ve been asked by LN maintainers to segregate some security information from the usual set of Core people handling issues. There is no need to distribute the information to a wider set of people than strictly necessary (see _need to know policy_). I do think Core having a clear policy at the image of the Linux kernel ones for cross-layer security handling would be very helpful. Fact is for now there is just no standard at all.\r\n\r\nFor anyone (either past or current core maintainer) asking to blindly “trust” the sec list member, let’s all remember the Gavin Andresen story, where its own maintenance rights has to be revoked [from a day to another](https://laanwj.github.io/2016/05/06/hostility-scams-and-moving-forward.html). I think this is a reasonable lesson to follow the principle of least privilege here.\r\n\r\nFor everyone information, I do have an old version of the security list members (no I didn’t buy it on the black market from an intel agency - I just got it during one of my past interaction with the list as someone screw up the server configuration…). So on my side, it’s not really knowing who is on it, it’s more about putting in place default-encrypted communications and “need to know” policy to make cross-layer security issues handling more straightforward. \r\n\r\nSo I think it would be reasonable to have the `SECURITY.md` modified where a security researcher as the initial disclosing party can ask the list of developers (domain experts) who will be informed initially about the issue and have them committed in some written record to a memorandum of understanding and documented process.\r\n\r\nIf anyone on the list or any core maintainer has the sentiment I’m taking them by “surprise” I can understand them. Those people are free to reach out me in private if they have questions, they have my contact. Yet they should be ready to receive critical security information at anytime, so saying you’re not “comfortable” is an avowal of weakness in my eyes and they shouldn’t work on sec issues of a backbone infra playing a part in a $1T project. It’s kinda the “navy seals” or “legion etrangere” of open-source software here in my opinion. \r\n\r\nTo be fair, I’ve pushed this conversation at CoreDev in Dublin, yet actually half-of the folks of the sec list where not present and 90% of the audience listening to my talk don’t have practical experience with sec issues handling so it made it a non-starter. Talking about it in public, sounds the only way to push forward the conversation. Refusing the conversation puts me in the position where I would have to improvise a mitigation and coordination process next time I found a substantial cross-layer security issue (it did happen every each 6 / 8 months over the last 4 years) or even found something affecting the stability of the base-layer (apologies I’m just to talented in matters of breaking things). \r\n\r\nSo unless someone has strong objections, I can open a PR to submit a draft on the example of the Linux one.",

I did voice those issues in private on one of my last security response endeavor.\r\n\r\nI’m satisfied with your answer that I’m free to ask specific people disclosed to who will be involved in fixing the problem, and make it clear if for mitigation and coordination purposes I refuse to work with a subset of people as the original disclosing party based on bad antecedents with this eventual subset.

    "title": "compact block fingerprinting",
    "body": "I haven't written a test for this, but it seems that a peer can fingerprint a chunk of our mempool by announcing a new compact block with a valid header, but inserting many `shorttxids` that don't belong to the block but are suspected to be in our mempool. Assuming no short id collisions, we'll then request each tx that we didn't find in either `vExtraTxnForCompact` or the mempool. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to fix this since compact block relay relies on this behavior. One possible way of fixing this was brought up here https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27086#issuecomment-1426937832. ",

For example, if we need X transactions to reconstruct the block, we could request Y transactions in GETBLOCKTXN where we have the other Y-X transactions. Adding these decoy transactions increases the BLOCKTXN response and could cause more round trips. We would also have to ignore the known transactions in BLOCKTXN.\r\n\r\nIf there are too many txn's that we're missing, we could fall back to block relay instead of trying to add many decoy transactions. According to [this data point](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27086#issuecomment-1426937832), compact block reconstruction works pretty well. Most of the time no reconstruction happens and sometimes only a few txn's are needed. So falling back to block relay should be unlikely.\r\n\r\nSince quick compact block relay is pretty important to avoid stale blocks, I'm not really sure how to weigh the privacy-bandwidth tradeoff.\r\n",

      "body": "I meant to reply but guess I never did. The point about blocks-only nodes is a good one. In the happy path, they aren't sent compact blocks since they never send `SENDCMPCT` to the peer again to set the high-bandwidth mode. But they can still be sent unsolicited compact blocks and because they can't reconstruct the blocks, it lets them be fingerprinted if anything is in their mempool. In most cases I don't think we can send `GETDATA` to fetch txns from blocksonly nodes since they never `INV` us anything. \n\nI think the only times a `-blocksonly` node will have a transaction is if they have a peer with the relay permission, in cases of reorg, or if they accidentally decide to broadcast a tx?",

      "body": "FWIW, this is solvable by changing to more fibre like methods for block transmission.  Because FEC coded missing data doesn't identify what was missing.\n\nSo I had *thought* the code would check if there were too many missing transactions and just request a full block if all were missing.  That doesn't address the general attack (since the attacker could admit some real txn that are in the block) but it would mostly address the blocksonly case (and could easily get a if blocksonly check so that it always did) -- but I can't find that.  It should be added.\n\nIt would also be prudent to just drop any unrequested compact block messages that show up outside of the correct protocol behavior (or treat them as header messages).  That would also eliminate the attack on blocks only peers and also discourage protocol violations that waste bandwidth (e.g. going around spamming everyone with compact blocks to try to speed up your own propagation).\n\nThe latter of these two should be much easier to implement and be a more comprehensive attack protection.\n\n\n",

      "body": "> So I had thought the code would check if there were too many missing transactions and just request a full block if all were missing. That doesn't address the general attack (since the attacker could admit some real txn that are in the block) but it would mostly address the blocksonly case (and could easily get a if blocksonly check so that it always did) -- but I can't find that. It should be added.\n\nIs this still useful if we add a patch to drop unsolicited `cmpctblock` messages? An attacker would still be able to do this to non-blocksonly peers, but as pointed out above by @mzumsande it doesn't seem particularly useful as the attacker could simply request the transactions directly from these peers.\n\nIf it is useful to fallback to the legacy BLOCK message in the non-blocksonly case, then should it only be done when all the transactions are missing or could it instead be if some % are missing?",

      "body": "I don't recall if the vulnerability related to requesting the transaction was closed (relay pool limited its scope at least to recently announced txn) but there were complications related to orphan txn (e.g. that relaying a transaction ought to imply permission to fetch its parents if they are still in your memory pool).  But if that vulnerability hasn't been closed it ought to be closed.   Edit: Sipa noted to me on IRC that the behavior now is that when you INV you grant only permission to fetch txn in your mempool up to that point in time (which is very close to equivalent to only granting permission to things that you've INVed (or would have inved if the peer had been connected)).  So I think the CB probing, in fact, is an additional information leak.\n\nIgnoring the unrequested CB is desirable for non-privacy reasons, specifically because if it doesn't someone might decide it's in their best interest to spam the entire network with an unrequested CB to try to improve propagation.  This has been done in the past with unsolicited BLOCKS (which is obviously much worse).   I haven't asked matt but I bet if this oversight weren't completely accidental I bet it was due to fibre sending them unsolicited, since if you were connecting to a fibre node at all obviously you did want blocks even if the HB logic hadn't yet selected you. --- since by the time CB were developed we'd already learned the lesson that being tolerant in what you accept turns out to cause trouble.\n\nJust in principle if there is some unsolicited activity that shouldn't exist it probably ought to at least be ignored if not outright triggering a disconnection.  There have been a lot of vulnerabilities in the past that could have been avoided or greatly mitigated by doing so, and sure sometimes it's discovered that it might be useful to have the behavior, but in that case the version that introduces the behavior can introduce a new message type or a handshake that confirms its okay.\n\n\n",

Now that we do have parallel compact block reconstruction, I wonder if we shouldn't disable this while at the same time bumping the parallelization limit (dunno what it is now but probably should be 3?) and increasing the HB peer set (they're pretty cheap, and it probably should have been higher to begin with).",

      "body": "The get transaction RT is the long pole mostly because Bitcoin Core won't respond to the request until it finishes validating the block (but will send the initial compact block prior to doing so). This makes it pretty slow depending on your peer, but also means that requesting it from many peers may be advantageous (because some peers will validate the block faster). Responding to the message should be ~free for the peers.\n\nIt might also be worth pointing out that dropping unsolicited messages probably won't accomplish all that much, though - you already have to be the first peer to provide a block in order to exploit this, and if you can do it once you can almost certainly do it a few times, at which point you will be an HB peer and can then exploit this normally. If we're worried about this, we probably need to tweak the protocol to include full txids so that the merkle root can be checked.",

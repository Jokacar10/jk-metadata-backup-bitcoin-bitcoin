    "title": "Migrate from BTC/kvB to sat/vB on RPC and startup options",
    "body": "This issue is motivated by the comments in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31088\n\nMost of the RPC and Startup options use BTC/kvB while the \"standardized\" units by users and other softwares is sats/vB.\nNote that updating to sat/vB can be backward incompatible in some cases.\n\nThere are two approaches that can be followed:\n- Update all to sat/vB even if that is not backward compatible (all in the same release). This has been done before with `bumpfee` and `psbtbumpfee`, before v0.21 were using BTC/kvB and after moved to sats/vB.\n- Add an option to use sats/vB but don't remove BTC/kvB. This has been done before with `fundrawtransaction` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt`.\n\n### List of Fee-Related Options and RPC Calls  \n\n#### Takes BTC/kvB as Argument\n##### **Startup Options**  \n- [ ] `-consolidatefeerate`  \n- [ ] `-discardfee`  \n- [ ] `-fallbackfee`  \n- [ ] `-mintxfee`  \n- [ ] `-paytxfee`  (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31278)\n- [ ] `-minrelaytxfee`  \n- [ ] `-blockmintxfee`  \n\n##### **RPC Calls**    \n- [ ] `sendrawtransaction`  \n- [ ] `submitpackage`  \n- [ ] `testmempoolaccept`  \n- [ ] `settxfee`  (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31278)\n\n#### Prints BTC/kvB as a Result\n##### **RPC Calls**  \n- [ ] `getmempoolinfo`  \n- [ ] `getnetworkinfo`  \n- [ ] `analyzepsbt`  \n- [ ] `submitpackage`  \n- [ ] `testmempoolaccept`  \n- [ ] `estimatesmartfee`  \n- [ ] `getwalletinfo`  \n\n#### Prints BTC as Units for Fee Instead of Sats \n##### **RPC Calls**  \n- [ ] `getmempoolinfo` (could make sense to keep BTC)  \n- [ ] `analyzepsbt`  \n- [ ] `createrawtransaction`  \n- [ ] `fundrawtransaction`  \n- [ ] `submitpackage`  \n- [ ] `testmempoolaccept`  \n- [ ] `walletcreatefundedpsbt`  \n",

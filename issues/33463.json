      "body": "> I'm not sure if `waitTipChanged` and `waitNext` can handle being interrupted before their timeouts yet, from either side\n\nThey are supposed to be handle it because they wait on `kernel_notifications.m_tip_block_cv` and `chainman.m_interrupt` which should both get signaled on shutdown.\n\nClient should also not need to do anything on shutdown and should just be disconnected.\n\nFrom the log it seems like ctrl-c is being processed, and shutdown is proceeding all the way up to the \"Shutdown down\" message, and then maybe the process is hanging? If so that's pretty interesting because there is no code after that in the Shutdown() function, and no code after that in the main() function calling Shutdown(), so it must mean there is some hang in some a destructor.\n\nMost useful thing to debug would be a stack trace, which you could get by running the process under GDB and running `thread apply all bt`. There was also another shutdown bug reported https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33387 and which my suggested patch could potentially address, or at least provide some more debug information. Other things to try might be running with `-debug=ipc` to log IPC calls and trying to stop the node with `bitcoin-cli stop` to see if the effect is the same as with ctrl-c\n\n",

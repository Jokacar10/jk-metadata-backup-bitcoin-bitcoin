Please save Bitcoin for the little guys like me so we can continue to run a node and home miners legally without fear.  I hope nothing immoral or illicit that is easily decodable ever makes it into the actual chain, the miner responsible should be immediately arrested who mined that block.  I don't want to relay this crap either before it makes it into the chain, that is still very dangerous for node runners.\n\nYou have the power, please choose correctly.",

      "body": "Nobody is prevented from anything, as nobody is required to run Bitcoin Core, v30 or otherwise. I realize this may sound snarky, but it is very sincere: Bitcoin's strength lies in the fact that the network is ultimately defined by what software people choose to run, of their own choice. I obviously disagree with you in this particular case, but I do hope that if ever Bitcoin Core actually ships changes that hurt the network, that you and other users choose to run something else.\n\nAs for motivation, see https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/06/06/relay-statement/. The point is the opposite of centralization: if network nodes refuse to relay transactions with active demand on the network, all it takes is for someone to build infrastructure to relay it to miners directly. And when that happens, (1) it becomes harder for new small miners to enter the business and reap the same rewards, especially anonymously and (2) your node will still be downloading and processing the same transactions, because once they make it into a block, you have no choice to accept them - doing otherwise would amount to forking off into your own currency.",

Larger miners already have several ways to hurt smaller miners within Bitcoin if they wish; it's a weakness of the system with large centralized mining pools that this new update will favor.  Bitcoin is for money; everything else on-chain is spam and exploits, or we risk breaking what Satoshi gifted humanity.  I do hope you are correct and this won't hurt Bitcoin, but from everything I can gather, it most certainly will.\n\nSomeone figured out how to do the \"hard\" way and hide illicit pictures in transactions, so instead of punishing that bad behavior, we are just gonna say, Hey, everyone, we are making it super easy for illicit pictures now, We thought it was too hard before.

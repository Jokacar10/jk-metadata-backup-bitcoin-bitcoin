Please save Bitcoin for the little guys like me so we can continue to run a node and home miners legally without fear.  I hope nothing immoral or illicit that is easily decodable ever makes it into the actual chain, the miner responsible should be immediately arrested who mined that block.  I don't want to relay this crap either before it makes it into the chain, that is still very dangerous for node runners.\n\nYou have the power, please choose correctly.",

    "title": "Decouple Datacarrier Size and Nulldata Output Limits",
    "body": "# DRAFT: PR #X Decouple Datacarrier Size and Nulldata Output Limits for Granular OP_RETURN Policy\n\nStatus: Draft | Target: Bitcoin Core v30.1 (Q4 2025) | Author: @jotapea\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith Bitcoin Core v30, support for multiple OP_RETURN outputs has been introduced, allowing up to 100,000 bytes in total.\n\nThis change aligns with miner incentives to accept data storage use, while enhancing Bitcoin's \"censorship resistance\". This is social debate, and out of the scope of this PR.\n\nHowever, v30's the aggregated `-datacarriersize` cap conflates per-output size with output count, perversely discouraging modular splitting, while openly (defaulting to) accepting arbitrary data via contiguous blobs.\n\nThis PR proposes decoupling the per-output size from the total number of OP_RETURN outputs to offer more granular control, while allowing features desired by Bitcoin participants. And allowed by consensus.\n\nAnd it also proposes the defaults to use.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n- **-datacarrier** (bool, default: 1): A flag to toggle OP_RETURN relay. When set to 0, this disables OP_RETURN transactions entirely. No changes here.\n\n- **-datacarriersize** (int, default: 83 bytes): The maximum allowed byte size for any individual OP_RETURN output. The default is the historical cap of 83 bytes, but this can be adjusted lower/higher. v30's aggregate value becomes `datacarriersize` * `datacarrierlimit`. A value of 0 means no size limit.\n\n- **-datacarrierlimit**- (int, default: 1): The maximum number of OP_RETURN outputs allowed per transaction. Setting this to 0 would allow an unlimited number of OP_RETURN outputs.\n\n## Implementation\n\nTBD.\n\n## Benefits & Trade-offs\n\n### Pros:\n\n- Offers greater flexibility for users to modularize data into one/multiple outputs, with configurable size and limits (covering both ends of the spectrum).\n\n- Retains money-first behavior with sensible defaults for `-datacarriersize` and `-datacarrierlimit`, mimicking historic consensus.\n\n- Disincentivizes the creation of unspendable burn outputs, making nulldata ouputs a superior alternative for output data needs.\n\n### Cons:\n\n- Minor increase in configuration complexity due to the introduction of one more parameter, though this is mitigated by better configurability.\n\n---\n---\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nThis can be a bit unusual, as there is no code yet for this. But that is the least of my worries.\n\nI just wanted to do something before [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/d0f6d9953a15d7c7111d46dcb76ab2bb18e5dee3) highly controversial release.\n\nAll feedback is welcomed.\n",

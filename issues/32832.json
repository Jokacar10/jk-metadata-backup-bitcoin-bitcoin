    "title": "[IBD] Raspberry Pi: 90% CPU time for 1.5% of block processing",
    "body": "There are numerous reports about how slow syncing on cheaper nodes (e.g. Raspberry Pi) is, a few recent ones from different platforms:\n\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32455#issuecomment-2977222246\n> I'm running a Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB of RAM and a 4TB SSD on RPi's Debian Lite Bookworm. This is a fresh install of v29 and after more than two weeks I'm only at blockheight of 829564 of 901531.\n\n* https://stacker.news/items/978269\n> IBD now, I am sitting at 7 days and only 78% synced. The progress has whittled down to only ~1-2% per day. At this rate I think it will take me another 2-3 weeks to finish initial sync. [...]\nI'm running bitcoin core 29.0 on 64bit Raspberry Pi OS (debian bookworm)\n\n* https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/125178/first-synchronized-has-been-running-for-7-days-and-is-at-82\n> have a raspberry pi 5 and the sync has been running for over a week and is only at 82%\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/getumbrel/comments/1chqna1/bitcoin_node_too_slow_to_sync\n> i have setup a raspberry pi 5 with umbrel and installed the bitcoin node and it is downloading the blockchain for more then 1 and half week. Its very very slow when it reached 91%.\n\n* https://community.umbrel.com/t/extremely-slow-initial-blockchain-sync-1-a-day/2777\n> download is VERY slow on my setup, like 1% a day\n\n* https://x.com/notgrubles/status/1952375546748477596\n> Something happened in the past 24 months that makes syncing on typical hard drives impossibly slow.\n\n* https://x.com/epic_curious/status/1728459624943079672\n> Every time I sync a full node on certain Thinkpads, thereâ€™s a distinct step-function change in CPU usage.\n\n-----\n\nAs part of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32043 I'm measuring IBD and `-reindex` performance regularly.\nDisplaying the resulting stack as flames (where the call graph of the methods is represented as the callee at the bottom and the final method at the top, deduplicating the parent methods, resulting in multiple similar leaves based on the call paths) indicates which areas of the code take most time:\n\nOn high-end devices we see that multithreaded script validation is a minor part of IBD (partially because of more threads, but the total is also a lot less dominant):\n<img width=\"1000\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36f4edd6-6e7b-4ccf-a331-70c65025b370\" />\n<details>\n<summary>source SVG</summary>\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f0722e4-b9e4-4599-9cd3-0934fdc7846d)\n</details>\n\nRecently I got access to several lower-end Raspberry Pi 4 devices. IBD took surprisingly long indeed, and the resulting flame graphs are quite surprising:\n<img width=\"1000\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2bb6db4-988a-42cc-88bd-9552e461cfdb\" />\n<details>\n<summary>source SVG</summary>\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adfe2ee4-6175-4bab-995b-253c036af636)\n</details>\n\nEven the hidden `ConnectTip` looks quite different...\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a89073e-b6fd-438a-83d9-3bcedc4aba35)\neven though it seems we do have SHANI optimizations that I first suspected as a possible culprit:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6530615-1bf1-4254-8896-adb5814dc2ba)\n\n(I'll add the details of the server later, but currently my Pi servers are frozen, they're very sensitive creatures)\n\n-----\n\nDoing an inverse flame to show the *own* time (where the final methods are at the top and their different callers are below, deduplicating the final methods, resulting in duplicated parents) is also very revealing:\n\nHetzner I7/i9 server:\n<img width=\"1000\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c862c25-5d97-448e-8335-fd0ec5aa5044\" />\n\nCorresponding to:\n```python\n=== Top 20 functions by self-time ===\n24,367,833,683,883 (12.53%) Lloop1_30\n16,614,495,487,954 ( 8.54%) secp256k1_fe_mul_inner\n9,671,690,320,529 ( 4.97%) std::_Hashtable<COutPoint, std::pair<COutPoint const, CCoinsCacheEntry>, Pool...\n8,048,128,525,665 ( 4.14%) Lloop2_30\n7,479,154,097,547 ( 3.85%) secp256k1_gej_double\n4,875,602,514,443 ( 2.51%) SipHashUint256Extra\n4,848,058,903,029 ( 2.49%) leveldb::(anonymous namespace)::BloomFilterPolicy::CreateFilter\n4,794,743,071,310 ( 2.47%) __memcmp_avx2_movbe\n4,683,317,778,516 ( 2.41%) __memmove_avx_unaligned_erms\n4,469,407,701,360 ( 2.30%) _int_malloc\n3,409,056,546,109 ( 1.75%) CSHA256::Write\n3,135,255,483,667 ( 1.61%) leveldb::SkipList<char const*, leveldb::MemTable::KeyComparator>::FindGreater...\n2,957,747,949,622 ( 1.52%) secp256k1_fe_sqrt\n2,473,661,676,032 ( 1.27%) leveldb::BlockBuilder::Add\n2,432,229,937,337 ( 1.25%) AutoFile::write_buffer\n2,309,378,132,280 ( 1.19%) _int_free\n2,272,582,522,437 ( 1.17%) malloc\n2,140,700,000,760 ( 1.10%) leveldb::MemTable::KeyComparator::operator\n2,088,998,156,937 ( 1.07%) AutoFile::detail_fread\n2,033,602,002,215 ( 1.05%) leveldb::InternalKeyComparator::Compare\n```\n\nPi - showing very heavy signature validation:\n<img width=\"1000\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9df5521-29c6-4635-aab7-44eefd627edb\" />\n\nI.e. almost 90% of the time is spent in signature validation even though only 1.5% of the blocks had them ((900000-[886157](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000001b658dd1120e82e66d2790811f89ede9742ada3ed6d77))/900000=1.5%)\n```python\n=== Top 20 functions by self-time ===\n45,200,219,094,553 (49.07%) secp256k1_fe_mul_inner\n17,059,129,066,358 (18.52%) secp256k1_gej_double\n4,958,246,221,561 ( 5.38%) secp256k1_fe_sqrt\n4,537,566,553,791 ( 4.93%) secp256k1_gej_add_ge_var\n2,679,543,872,014 ( 2.91%) secp256k1_fe_sqr_inner\n1,776,534,490,509 ( 1.93%) CSHA256::Write\n1,423,064,476,505 ( 1.54%) secp256k1_ecmult_strauss_wnaf.constprop.0\n1,406,501,260,817 ( 1.53%) sha256_arm_shani::Transform\n1,160,517,562,371 ( 1.26%) __memcpy_generic\n1,087,798,904,524 ( 1.18%) secp256k1_ge_from_storage\n967,511,395,459 ( 1.05%) secp256k1_gej_add_zinv_var\n837,850,817,824 ( 0.91%) secp256k1_modinv64_var\n613,159,858,561 ( 0.67%) cfree@GLIBC_2.17\n490,119,900,000 ( 0.53%) secp256k1_ecmult_wnaf.constprop.0.isra.0\n474,344,476,011 ( 0.51%) uint256 SignatureHash<CTransaction>\n462,336,566,142 ( 0.50%) SignatureCache::Get\n455,625,547,742 ( 0.49%) GetScriptOp\n393,204,249,970 ( 0.43%) MurmurHash3\n387,212,664,603 ( 0.42%) CRollingBloomFilter::insert\n375,980,794,732 ( 0.41%) secp256k1_modinv64_update_de_62.isra.0\n```\n\n(it's possible I ran the two measurements with slightly different configs since it took weeks to convince the Pi not to overheat or OOM in the middle of measurements.

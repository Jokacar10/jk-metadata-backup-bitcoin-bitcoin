    "title": "assumevalid is not always applied when reindexing",
    "body": "`assumevalid` (which disables script verification and therefore speeds up IBD) is not always applied in the context of a `-reindex`:\r\n \r\nThe assumevalid criteria are\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d73f37dda221835b5109ede1b84db2dc7c4b74a1/src/validation.cpp#L2497-L2500\r\n\r\nmeaning that our best known header needs to have at least as much work than the hard-coded minchainwork. \r\nDuring normal IBD, we don't connect blocks before having minchainwork headers (headers sync phase), so this is not a problem.\r\nHowever,`-reindex` deletes the block tree db and attempts to rebuild it based on local block files, without attempting to re-request headers for which we don't have the full block yet (because we didn't get to that point in the previous IBD).\r\n\r\nTherefore, users that encounter an error somewhere midway through IBD and need to reindex, won't use `-assumevalid` and will rebuild the chainstate slowly. \r\nThis has also been encountered in the context of benchmarking.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n - always enable assumvalid while connecting blocks in the context of reindexing\r\n - attempt to sync remaining headers via the p2p nework after rebuilding the block tree db, but before calling `ActivateBestChain()` to start connecting blocks",

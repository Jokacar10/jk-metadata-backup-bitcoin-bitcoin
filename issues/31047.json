    "body": "Porting this issue from: https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/issues/341.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear if using our Coverage build type works with Clang, or not. In the linked thread there are simultaneous claims that it \"works\", but also that it does not work. It seems from the discussion that even using GCC with the Coverage build type is flaky.\r\n\r\nThere's been suggestions to add a Coverage mode for Clang: https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/233, however adding a second way of doing things, when the current way may not work properly, and (likely?) currently isn't being used by anyone, doesn't seem like a good approach, and adds even more complication to the build system. Note that devs are already using Clang for coverage regardless of if it currently exists in the build system (cc @dergoegge, @marcofleon, @vasild).\r\n\r\nIf using Clangs native coverage mode is what is preferred/is \"better\", then it'd seem better for us to replace the current, more GCC focussed implementation, with one that is geared towards LLVM/Clang, if the idea is to provide something that works out-of-the-box, and is generally used by the developers working on the project.",

The coverage reports themselves were always hard to read and I could not find any documentation on how to read them, for example:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-10-07 12-18-00](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16e4469b-542c-44be-b305-d26f6a6d2092)\r\n\r\nHow is branch coverage supposed to be interpreted from this?\r\n\r\nI've switched all my coverage reports to using LLVM's native coverage tooling: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html#id3. I don't use our build in command to produce coverage reports but I think it's a useful thing to have, so devs can easily produce their own coverage reports. I can recommend switching to LLVM's native coverage reporting, as that has been far less of a struggle in my experience.",

(Should there be a coverage build type or is it sufficient and more flexible to just document the cmake configure flags as well as handling of the coverage data? Should there be gcc support at all?)\n* Implement a pull based on that, along with a quick note on the required changes to affected places\n* Review and merge the pull on its own pace",

Seems like there is also some [agreement there](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31588#issuecomment-2651994364) to switch to LLVM/Clang.\n\nI don't use macOS, nor have I tested this specific bash script on the different Linux distros mentioned, so I can't vouch for the problems, but it looks like some people ran into problems and shared them in the thread. In any case that specific script seems to be a dev-only test-only contrib script with 0(?) users right now, where at least the suppression list is stale. So I removed it from the milestone in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31588#issuecomment-2652009268. I'll follow-up with my follow-up, but earliest I can do is next week or later.\n\n> I'm not sure we should ship something just because it exists, maybe just to delete it in the next release; that's why it's attached to a milestone.\n\nIt not only exists, but it is also used. For example:\n\n* [corecheck](https://github.com/corecheck/corecheck/blob/7734c3773da2ae2f133b7a720dee7d3ede966520/workers/coverage-worker/entrypoint.sh#L50), https://github.com/corecheck/corecheck/issues/96\n* https://maflcko.github.io/b-c-cov/\n* https://github.com/maflcko/DrahtBot/blob/1cce096df7cb4d89d34bcdbed09b20a38fe2a344/coverage_fuzz/src/main.rs#L40 (used for qa-asset commits (see that repo), or bitcoin core commits: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31841#issuecomment-2656491879)\n* https://github.com/maflcko/DrahtBot/blob/1cce096df7cb4d89d34bcdbed09b20a38fe2a344/coverage/src/main.rs#L40 (not used recently, but can be used on any bitcoin core commit post cmake)\n\nIf those use cases are considered invalid, then removing it seems fine. However, if others think that those are useful use-cases, then my recommendation would be to first update them and then remove the feature.\n\nIf there are any risks or downsides in removing the milestone from this issue, it would help to list them. If it is just a documentation problem that the \"feature\" will be removed, it should be trivial to fix:\n\n`sed -i 's/Coverage/DangerCoverageExperimentalWillBeRemoved/g' ...`",

Modern LLVM's coverage tool _emulates_ GCC's `gcov` version 4.2.0, which is obviously outdated.\n2. Recent versions of the `lcov` tool no longer support GCC/gcov versions older than 9.x. For example:\n```\nlcov: WARNING: (unsupported) Function begin/end line exclusions not supported with this version of GCC/gcov; require gcc/9 or newer: attempting to derive function end lines - see lcovrc man entry for 'derive_function_end_line'.\n```\nThus, I must conclude that the answer is \"No.\"\n\nThe current \"Coverage\" build type should be considered and documented as GCC-only.",

The current GCC-oriented method we have [does work](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31047#issuecomment-2658930755) with GCC, contrary to what the OP suggests \"the current way may not work properly\".\n\nSo, to me it looks like that removing the current GCC-oriented way could affect some developers in a negative way. I could be wrong though. Maybe none of the Linux people generate code coverage? 👀  Or they bother to install Clang additionally and use that?\n\nLets see if a quick poll on IRC would help bring some clarity to this: https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2025-06-12.html#l-69\n",

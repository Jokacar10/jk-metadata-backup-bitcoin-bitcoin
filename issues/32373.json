    "title": "rfc: only relay transactions to v2 encrypted peers",
    "body": "Unless we don't have any.\n\nOne of the goals of p2p traffic encryption was to make it impossible for passive observers to figure out where a transaction originates. However as long as there's enough unencrypted connections remaining, that doesn't seem very effective.\n\nAssuming v2 transport adoption has reached an acceptable level, it may be a good time to start preferring it more strongly.\n\nSpecifically I would suggest that we only relay transactions to v2 peers.\n\nIf a v1 peer asks for a transaction, we should probably just give it to them. I suspect it's break of backward compatibility if we don't?\n\nWe probably also want to continue receiving transactions from such peers, so we can't just pretend to be blocksonly.",

      "body": "It seems like ideal solution would be to get debian to build capnproto package with GCS, maybe submitting a patch or issue requesting this. There should be no downside to enabling GCS, since it modifies return instructions but is otherwise ABI compatible, and the GCS feature can be turned on and off per thread at runtime. Only difficultly may be that capnproto dependencies (openssl and zlib) will also need to be built with GCS. There's a debian page at https://wiki.debian.org/ToolChain/GCS with some information but it's unclear which debian libraries are already using it. It should be possible to check .so files manually with instructions there:\n\n```\n$ readelf -n ./hello | grep AArch64\nProperties: AArch64 feature: BTI, PAC, GCS\n```\n\nThere may be changes we want to make to our build system too. The warnings in the description above happen when building `mptest` and `mpgen` binaires, and maybe GCS could be disabled for these binaries. Assuming the same warning happen when when building other binaries like  ~`bitcoind`~ `bitcoin-node` and `test_bitcoin` it's probably not worth it.\n\n",

But I would expect warnings to appear when linking `bitcoin-node` and `test_bitcoin`. It would be unexpected if make VERBOSE=1 output showed `bitcoin-node` being linked `libcapnp.so` but not producing these warning. I think the only possible explanation then would be that binaries like `bitcoin-node` were being built without GCS, but binaries like `mpgen` were being built with it? This would seem like something to debug and fix.\n",

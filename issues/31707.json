It would also be nice to have a short explanation for newcomers about the risks of using a pre-built image. And most importantly: How can I make sure that the DockerHub images are actually built from this repository? I can see some GitHub actions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/523520f8279987cd528a9e2db6db13dc56641eff/src/secp256k1/.github/actions/run-in-docker-action/action.yml), but I only found them by digging deep into the repo.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA clear explanation on how the Docker images are being built (referencing the GitHub workflows would be nice!) and also a clear statement about whether [this DockerHub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitcoin/bitcoin) is owned by the maintainers of this project.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nI am willing to contribute, if necessary.",

      "body": " \tHi @raweber42\n\nThese docker images are not owned or maintained by the project, but rather by myself. I.e they are **not** official. They are aimed at testing environments (e.g. for other bitcoin-adjacent projects), as it is non-trivial to verify the authenticity of the bitcoin core binaries inside (but it is possible in some cases, see below).\n\nTo answer your questions more concretely:\n\nAs detailed in the project README.md:\n\n> The Debian-based (non-alpine) images use pre-built binaries pulled from bitcoincore.org or bitcoin.org (or both) as availability dictates. These binaries are built using the Bitcoin Core [reproducible build](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/guix/README.md) system, and signatures attesting to them can be found in the [guix.sigs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs) repo. Signatures are checked in the build process for these docker images using the [verify_binaries.py](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/verify-binaries) script from the bitcoin/bitcoin git repository.\n>\n> The alpine images are built from source inside the CI.\n>\n> The nightly master image is currently alpine-based, source-built, and targeted at the linux/amd64 platform.\n\nThis effectively means that:\n\n1. Non-alpine tagged images are pulled as tarballs from https://bitcoincore.org/bin/ and the binaries have their guix signatures checked using a copy of our verify-binaries.py script.\n\n2. Alpine images are built on-demand inside the GitHub Actions CI\n\n3. Nightly master image is built on-demand inside the GitHub Actions CI\n\n-----\n\nWhen using Bitcoin Core software for non-testing purposes you should always ensure that you have either: i) built it from source yourself, or ii) verfied your binary download (see [this page](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) for more information on how to do this).\n\nWhilst I have followed this procedure myself in creating these images, you should not trust me (or anyone else) providing docker images (or any other source of pre-built binaries!).\n\nWhilst you can in theory pull the non-nightly, debian-based images, boot into a shell, and verify the binary inside using the same verification instructions from bitcoincore.org/en/download, it's not the most ergonomic process, and you are likely better off re-building the image yourself using the Dockerfile after reading through it, so that you don't have to trust me.\n\nThe reason these are at bitcoin/bitcoin on Dockerhub is that there was previously a squatted project there with very old images, which I took up ownership of.\n\nThanks for asking about this, I should clarify more of this information in the README on that project.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about this, otherwise feel free to close this issue.",

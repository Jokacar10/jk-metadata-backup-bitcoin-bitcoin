    "body": "#32359 allows for larger contiguous payloads to end up in the mempool than what can be achieved with inscriptions. This might trip a naive virus scanner into false positives.\n\nIt seems like a good precaution to XOR existing mempools, rather than only new mempools. Assuming this feature has been tested well enough by now, a migration seems relatively safe.",

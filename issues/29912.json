(If there is, then that is a bug in Bitcoin Core, which should be fixed)\r\n\r\n> https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/\r\n\r\nThis example has many issues:\r\n\r\n* It is not machine readable\r\n* It does not indicate the version of Bitcoin Core that is documented\r\n* It is wrong and outdated. For example https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getrawtransaction.html#argument-2-verbose is wrong. The type should be `int`, not a `bool`. Also it is missing verbose=3.\r\n* It has all the problems that I mentioned in the original post.\r\n\r\n>  https://wbnns.github.io/bitcoin-dev-docs/reference/rpc/index.html\r\n\r\nThis is the same as above, just rendered differently.\r\n\r\n>  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md\r\n\r\nI am aware of the file, because I initially wrote it. It describes the concept of the interface, but it is not a specification.\r\n\r\n> https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29\r\n\r\nThis is a wiki page that lists some manually maintained software projects, so all of them have the issues I mentioned in the original post. I don't have the time right now to list all the bugs they have, but if you spend enough time you will find that they are either not a specification, or that they are unmaintained for years, or that they have implementation errors.\r\n\r\nEdit: If there is a single software project out there, which currently correctly and fully implements the RPC API in a type-safe manner, it would be interesting to see how they approached it. But I doubt there is one?",

I believe @laanwj commented on it.\r\n\r\nMuch of it is already there, just not exposed. The `RPCHelpMan`/`RPCResult` structure for `help` handling was intended to be a start of formalizing the API, and to have some form of introspection. E.g. types are already checked against the spec while testing. It could be extended to include other data that's needed.\r\n\r\nThe same data that's used for rendering help could be returned on the RPC in a raw, machine-readable structured format. Easiest would be to define our own format, but if there is a suitable standard format that will work for JSON-RPC that's of course preferable. I don't think there was at the time I looked into it, but who knows.",

      "body": "Having a formal spec, either [generated similarly to the current RPC docs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org/blob/master/contrib/doc-gen/generate.go) (or possibly used to generate stub headers which are then implemented in Bitcoin Core) lowers friction for application developers building on top of Bitcoin Core and reduces temptation to build on top of other projects (including non-Bitcoin ones).\r\n\r\nBeen digging into OpenRPC a bit. It seems to be used primarily by Ethereum and Ethereum Classic devs, see the usage section: https://open-rpc.org/use\r\n\r\nRegardless, I think the idea behind OpenRPC seems fairly sound, since OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) is fairly path-centric, while our JSON-RPC interface only uses [one main path + wallet path](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md#endpoints).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@kilianmh\r\nThanks for bringing awareness of OpenRPC!\r\n\r\nWhile Common Lisp is cool, I'm not sure how easy it would be to get it merged into the Bitcoin Core *contrib/* directory, nor the repo for bitcoin.org. Furthermore, it seems like your implementation consists of manually copy-pasting the text from the C++ code into [*main.lisp*](https://codeberg.org/kilianmh/bitcoin-core-openrpc/src/branch/master/src/main.lisp) unless some wizardry is escaping me. A more automated way would be to do something like the Golang RPC doc generator in my first link above.\r\n\r\n* How well does OpenRPC support units like \"BTC/kvB\"?\r\n  It seems you've defined maxfeerate in sendrawtransaction quite loosely in https://codeberg.org/kilianmh/bitcoin-core-openrpc/src/branch/master/src/main.lisp#L1307-L1312 (and you dropped the \"v\" from \"kvB\", which changes meaning).\r\n* Conversely, have you noticed anything bitcoind does that goes against the OpenRPC spec?\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "I had no idea this issue existed! Thanks @0xB10C for sharing and for the ping.\r\n\r\nMy motivation was the current situation with Rust Bitcoin Core JSON RPC client crates, which is not great. There's one which is mostly complete, [rust-bitcoincore-rpc](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoincore-rpc), but which is now unmaintained, and a successor project [rust-bitcoind-json-rpc](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoind-json-rpc/), which is incomplete, but looks like it's a little more principled, and is being actively developed.\r\n\r\nThe RPC API has a huge surface area, so I was thinking that trying to extract some description of the API from Core as JSON and using code generation to automate generation of as much of the API as possible might be a good approach.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to find that `RPCHelpMan` has all the structured information you might want, so I wrote the above [branch](https://github.com/casey/bitcoin/blob/rpc-json/), which adds a new `api` RPC method.\r\n\r\nThe API RPC method exports an API description as JSON based on the entries in `mapCommand`, the dictionary which holds all RPC commands. It introduces a new `UniValue ToDescriptionValue()` method (so named because it's very close to `ToDescriptionString()`) which is implemented for `RPCHelpMan`, `RPCArg`, etc, and is called recursively to build up a `UniValue` which describes the entire API surface area.\r\n\r\nI went with an ad-hoc format, mostly out of concerns that the RPC API is quirky, with things like return types differing depending on argument values (like verbosity levels), so I was concerned that the RPC API might not be possible to express in, e.g., JSON Schema.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the JSON is not ideal, and carries with it many quirks of how the API is internally structured in Core. I wasn't sure which of these quirks were important, and should be exposed, and which should be papered over, so I erred on the side of caution, and exposed all of those quirks in the generated JSON.\r\n\r\nI could definitely use help understanding those quirks.\r\n\r\nThose quirks are:\r\n\r\n- `mapCommands` is a `map<string, vector<CRPCCommand*>>`, so a map of strings to lists of commands, so the `api.json` that I generate also maps names to lists of commands, instead of mapping each name to a single command.\r\n\r\n  Why is this? Are there actually multiple implementations of the same command? I tested this, and I could be wrong, but I think that when you are not building in test configuration, the map is never populated with more than one command of the same name, but in testing it is (my assert which fired whenever a duplicate command was added fired in tests.).\r\n\r\n  If multiple implementations aren't present in a release configuration, I change the generated JSON to be a map of names to single commands, which would be simpler.\r\n\r\n- `RPCArg::m_names` has this comment: `can contain multiple aliases separated by | for named request arguments`. As a result, the generated JSON for an RPCArg has `names` key, whose value is a list of names. However, I could not find an instance of this being used in the code.\r\n\r\nIs there appetite for landing this in core? Some random thoughts:\r\n\r\n- I think that using JSON Schema would be ideal, assuming that the API can be expressed in JSON Schema. OpenAPI is also appealing, which would allow describing both the types and the list of endpoints, but it does not look to be geared towards RPC-style APIs where all calls are issued against the same path. It expects a REST-style API where each endpoint has a different path.\r\n\r\n- To keep PRs small and easy to review, it might be a good idea to implement it in layers. I.e., first implement an API RPC call which simply returns a map of RPC methods to JSON Schema definitions for the request and response types, but only define those request and response types as returning `object` (or some `any` type). Then, follow-up PRs could add a new layer, for example, defining the names of the request properties, but keeping their types as `any`, and so forth and so on, until the API is fully defined.",

      "body": "I started working on a [branch](https://github.com/casey/bitcoin/tree/json-schema) which uses JSON schema, instead of an ad-hoc format. So far it seems fine! I started with command arguments first, since they're much simpler than command results.\r\n\r\nI tried to keep everything self-contained in `src/rpc/schema.{h,cpp}` files. If someone winds up using this to codegen support for current versions of core, they may wish to back-port it to older versions of core, and having it mostly be in one place helps with that.\r\n\r\nTo easily see the output, the generated schema is saved in [schema.json](https://github.com/casey/bitcoin/blob/json-schema/schema.json).\r\n\r\nWhat would be needed, in addition to cleaning it up and supporting results, to consider merging this into Core?\r\n\r\nIn particular, I'm curious what kind of tests would be needed. At a minimum, I'd like to have a way to validate the schemas themselves, i.e., that they are at least properly formed JSON Schemas. However, that would not guarantee that the schemas actually correctly describe the JSON RPC API, which is the goal.\r\n\r\nThe fastest way to add tests for the schemas would be to leverage existing tests which call the JSON RPC API. During testing, requests and responses would be validated against the corresponding schema, and the test would fail if the schemas didn't match the actual values.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't find a good-looking C++ JSON Schema library to use for this, but it may be possible to call an external command which does the validation, in which case there are a number of good options available.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to consider them experimental, and hide the `schema` command which produces them until there's more confidence.",

      "body": "> i'm going to look into creating a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) based specification for the RPC JSON interface. This is the same standard that [c-lightning uses](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/master/doc/schemas), so we could even share some of their code generation tooling (say, for generating Rust RPC bindings automatically, or a JSON-to-protobuf proxy 😅 ) and documentation generation (manpages, website).\r\n> \r\n> This can, for large part, be exported mechanically from the descriptions in RPCHelpMan, though it will have to be augmented to be complete and precise (different units and such), and to have better documentation.\r\n\r\nI just stumbled over this reading the bitcoinoptech mail. I'd be absolutely thrilled if the RPC generation code were to be adopted by Bitcoin Core. As the original author let me add a bit of color: we currently generate two kinds of things in CLN (the wire protocol using a generate-wire.py script, and the RPC starting from the JSON Schema). Since we want to eventually unify the two we went for a source agnostic representation, so we start by reading the schema source (weird CSV files for the wire, and JSON Schema for the RPC), we then lift it into an in-memory model, that we can then enrich with data that isn't part of the schema (e.g., protobuf field numbering, versioning information such as the version a field was added / removed, ...). From that rich in-memory representation we can then generate all other representations, and conversion codes between them.\r\n\r\nHere's a brief summary of generated interfaces:\r\n\r\n - Rust client library\r\n - Python client library\r\n - Protobuf and grpc schema generation\r\n - Conversion from Rust to grpc\r\n - Reverse proxies with and without translation between representations\r\n\r\nIn addition, since we have funneled the schemas through to the client libraries we can actually verify and enforce schema-adherence while running tests, by just setting a validation flag in the client connection.\r\n\r\nNow for what I can offer to do here:\r\n\r\n - We likely want to split the `msggen` package out of CLN, put it in a separately controlled repo\r\n - CLN and Bitcoin Core would then make use of the library to implement the conversions and representations they need, upstreaming if/when we notice that there is a common pattern.\r\n\r\nThat would also play to our own needs, since we have `msggen`-derivations in a number of other projects that currently are dependent on the CLN repo.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's just an offer, and I'm happy if some other solution is better suited for Core :-)",

    "title": "IBD performance regression in 27.0rc1 on Windows",
    "body": "While investigating the variance in IBD when synchronizing from network nodes and comparing it to synchronizing from a local node, I noticed a significant slowdown when I switched the synchronizing node to 27.0rc1. When connected to a local node (also 27.0rc1), it reaches block 120,000 about 10% slower on average than 26.0, with a much higher variance. I measured around 100 runs of each, alternating between the versions every time. Headers (pre-)sync is not included in the measurement. OS is Windows 10, I'm using pre-built binaries for both versions.\r\n\r\n26.0:\r\n![ibd26corrected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/43024885/e3b3c7de-ebe8-4620-8ad2-b60ce3375551)\r\n\r\n27.0rc1:\r\n![ibd27rc1corrected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/43024885/02aa6e7b-5fd0-46f3-bf1e-0be30f1bdcf7)\r\n\r\nEDIT: The issue seems to be only with the pre-built release binary for Windows. Tests with a pre-built Linux binary on WSL and a self-built MSVC binary don't show the regression (see later posts).",

So maybe comparing the micro-benchmarks can provide a hint at which code is slower?",

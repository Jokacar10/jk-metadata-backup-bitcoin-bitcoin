    "title": "upstream: capnp V2 doesn't support compilation with GCC (yet?)",
    "body": "See https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/pull/2304, and the discussion from the maintainer. Seems like the interest in supporting GCC is pretty secondary:\n> Is there any way we can get a CI build that tests GCC support? Otherwise I'm sure it'll just bitrot again.\n\n> OK, seems fine to merge now but we can't really claim that GCC is \"supported\" until we have CI tests since it'll probably bitrot.\n\nWhen that PR lands, it looks like they be supporting GCC 14.2 and later.\n\nAssuming we are going to support / use capnp V2 at some point, it would be good if it did support GCC, if it doesn't, we'll have to bootstrap & use both Clang and GCC, for Linux builds in Guix, or patch capnp until it works with (our version of) GCC, or something else.\n\nhttps://capnproto.org/roadmap.html, seems pretty outdated (still lists pre-1.x items) it's not really clear when V2 is planned to happen.",

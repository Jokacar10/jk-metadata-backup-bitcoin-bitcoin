    "body": "              Removing the check for nDataOut > 1 would allow multiple OP_RETURN outputs in a single transaction, which goes against the standard behavior of the Bitcoin protocol. This could introduce several issues:\r\n\r\nNon-standard transactions: Multiple OP_RETURN outputs in a transaction are considered non-standard. Allowing them could lead to network inconsistencies, as some nodes might not be able to properly process or relay these transactions.\r\n\r\nNetwork congestion: More OP_RETURN outputs would increase transaction size, reducing the number of transactions that can be included in each block, which could lead to increased network congestion.\r\n\r\nCompatibility problems: Non-standard transactions could cause compatibility issues with other nodes, wallets, and services that expect standard behavior.\r\n\r\nMaintaining this check ensures that Bitcoin transactions remain within the protocol's standards, preventing these potential issues and maintaining network stability.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @mrberlinorg in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32359#discussion_r2068154281_\r\n            ",

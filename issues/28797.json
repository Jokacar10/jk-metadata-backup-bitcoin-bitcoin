The latter shouldn't be possible given that `getaddressinfo` reports both addresses as ismine. Can you check if there is some transaction in your wallet that is spending that output but wasn't broadcast?\r\n\r\nIt could be that the output is locked with `lockunspent`, but that should only affect `listunspent` and not `getbalance`.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think it's possible to replicate this without having the private keys or even the wallet itself. Watchonly is a different set of conditions.\r\n\r\nCan you provide more details on how this wallet was constructed, e.g. were things imported?\r\n\r\nIf you import the privkeys into a new wallet, does it exhibit the same problem?",

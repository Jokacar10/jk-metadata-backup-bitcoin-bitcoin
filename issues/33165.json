    "title": "Add optional BIP39 mnemonic seed support for descriptor wallets",
    "body": "Ever since Bitcoin Core moved from legacy HD wallets to descriptor wallets, we lost one of the best features: a single, human-readable seed (BIP39-style) that could restore everything.\n\nRight now descriptor wallets are a pain to back up. You’ve got to dump a bunch of long, ugly descriptor strings, and if you ever add a new descriptor you’ve got to back it up again or risk losing access. It’s harder for regular users and even for technical people it’s just more work.\n\nLegacy wallets weren’t perfect, but the 12–24 word seed backup was simple, portable, and nearly impossible to mess up. Descriptor wallets might be the future, but they shouldn’t require a PhD to back up safely.\n\nI’m asking to add an option when creating a descriptor wallet to generate a single master seed (BIP39 or similar) that covers all wallet keys. If you want complex setups with multiple xpubs, fine, but let single-seed wallets be restorable from one backup.\n\nThe way it is now, it’s too easy for people to end up with incomplete backups. Descriptor wallets should be better than legacy in every way, not worse in something as basic as backup and restore.",

    "body": "Testnet3 was deprecated in v28 with the introduction of testnet4. #31974 implements its removal.\n\nDropping it in v30 seems reasonable to me, but let's discuss this here as to not clutter the implementation PR.\n\nNote that v29 (coming soon), which includes testnet3, will be supported for a while. See https://bitcoincore.org/en/lifecycle/\n\n@instagibbs wrote:\n\n> I've said it elsewhere, but I think it deserves a quite long deprecation cycle, along with some data gathering.\n> \n> We don't want services not upgrading for fixes because their test environment would break.\n> \n> e.g., what exchanges with testnet environments have adopted testnet4 (or signet), much less would be ok with removing testnet3?\n> \n> Does btcd support it? LND? Eclaire? CLN? etc.\n> \n> Lots of work to be done here imo.",

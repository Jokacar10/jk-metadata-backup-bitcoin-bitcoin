    "body": "Testnet3 was deprecated in v28 with the introduction of testnet4. #31974 implements its removal.\n\nDropping it in v30 seems reasonable to me, but let's discuss this here as to not clutter the implementation PR.\n\nNote that v29 (coming soon), which includes testnet3, will be supported for a while. See https://bitcoincore.org/en/lifecycle/\n\n@instagibbs wrote:\n\n> I've said it elsewhere, but I think it deserves a quite long deprecation cycle, along with some data gathering.\n> \n> We don't want services not upgrading for fixes because their test environment would break.\n> \n> e.g., what exchanges with testnet environments have adopted testnet4 (or signet), much less would be ok with removing testnet3?\n> \n> Does btcd support it? LND? Eclaire? CLN? etc.\n> \n> Lots of work to be done here imo.",

It think a mailing list post is in order and if nobody complains for good reason (not \"I'm rich there\") then I would even be fine with removal in v30. We can also do a Github grep and reach out to open source projects directly that still have it implemented if the ML post doesn't seem sufficient alone.",

      "body": "> At this point, another Bitcoin testnet is becoming unusable for devs, with huge reorgs for months and another likely incoming. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2b8f678-8eed-4524-b565-212044e59ef0)\n\nFork Obsever also shows frequent reorgs on testnet4: https://fork.observer/?network=4\n\nHowever they don't look \"huge\" to me, just frequent. It's good if you're trying to write code that robust against reorgs.\n\nTestnet5 is not going to magically fix all problems though. It seems useful to discuss ideas on the bitcoin-dev mailinglist or Delving.\n\n> Signet isn’t an option since we need to test hashrate-related proofs for BitVM, but Testnet4 is becoming more painful to use every day.\n\nYou can run a custom signet with `OP_TRUE` as the challenge and it will behave like a normal proof-of-work chain. See https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0325:\n\n> There is one other acceptable special case: if a block's challenge is e.g. `OP_TRUE` (`0x51`), where an empty solution would result in success, the block is also considered valid if the signet commitment is absent.\n\nSee also #29032.",

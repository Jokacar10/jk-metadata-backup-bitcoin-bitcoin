    "title": "tsan: drop `DEBUG_LOCKORDER` macro from TSAN job?",
    "body": "It was pointed out in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32862#issuecomment-3114706601 that that PR uncovered a false positive libc++ tsan warning. It was not initially clear to me why the issue was not happening in the TSAN CI. The reason it does not, is because of `DEBUG_LOCKORDER`. Dropping that from the TSAN CI job does shows the issue. i.e #33081.\n\nI am wondering if the TSAN job should be split up, so that TSAN & `DEBUG_LOCKORDER` do not interfere with each other. It seems better to not have false positives (or real issues/anything else) in other tooling suppressed, by our own tooling, and instead be able to directly suppress/document issues, and properly report them upstream.",

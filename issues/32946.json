    "title": "Why bitcoin use so many RecursiveMutex",
    "body": "I have noticed that in the Bitcoin source code, almost all thread-safe sections use `RecursiveGuard`. \nAs we all know, `RecursiveGuard` is **exclusive**, which can **impact system performance and concurrency**.\n\nAt the same time, I have also noticed [another issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19303) specifically tracking the replacement of `RecursiveMutex` with `Mutex`, which would help reduce some of the locking overhead.\n\nHowever, I think `Mutex` is still **exclusive**. For modules like the **transaction pool**, which involve both reading and writing transactionsâ€”such as querying pending transactions and inserting new ones.\n\nwouldn't using a `read-write lock (SharedMutex)` directly provide better performance? If I make this kind of modification, is it officially recommended?",

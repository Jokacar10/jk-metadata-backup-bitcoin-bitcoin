    "body": "Some chatter from IRC:\n\n```\n17:21:41 < darosior> It might be confusing to release both a bitcoin-wallet utility and a bitcoin-wallet binary as part of multiprocess?\n17:24:08 < darosior> We could rename the utility, but then it would be nice to at least have one deprecation cycle. Given recent momentum i estimate it's possible we might release multiprocess in \n                     30.0, which means if we want to deprecate the bitcoin-wallet utility name we should do it.. now?\n17:33:31 < sipa> bitcoin-wallet-util ?\n...\n23:38:57 < _aj_> darosior: bitcoin-wallet-process, bitcoin-gui-process, etc? it's multi *-process!\n03:04:34 < Sjors[m]> darosior: at the moment there is no wallet binary if were to enable multiprocess. That won't happen until #19460.\n...\n03:05:18 < Sjors[m]> Or maybe already in #10102\n...\n03:05:50 < Sjors[m]> In any case #31802 only adds bitcoin-node and bitcoin-gui.\n...\n03:07:19 < Sjors[m]> Though if we want to rename the utility eventually, it's always better to do it early.\n```",

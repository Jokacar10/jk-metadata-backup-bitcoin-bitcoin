    "title": "Duplicate coinbase transaction space reservation in CreateNewBlock",
    "body": "In `BlockAssembler::CreateNewBlock`, we initiate `nBlockWeight` to 4000 WU, reserving space for\r\ncoinbase transaction.\r\n\r\nLatter on, while iterating on transactions for block inclusion in `addPackagesTxs`, we verify that candidate package doesn't overflow the max block weight. This check is done in `TestPackage` against `nBlockMaxWeight`. However, default value is DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT which is equal to MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT - 4000 (L20 in `src/policy/policy.cpp`). So block weight assembled is starting at 4000 WU and can't overflow 3996000 WU.\r\n\r\nDo we have duplicated coinbase transaction space reservation ? I can see this a safety margin to avoid creating invalid blocks if you create inflated coinbase transaction, at the price of few weight units leftover.\r\n\r\nIf so, maybe we should leave it as it is but document this behavior, I was surprised hitting this while scratching unrelated tests.\r\n\r\nSee [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11100#discussion_r135124178) in #11100",

They may be the only pool using their own software to create block templates?\r\n\r\nI'm fairly certain they use Bitcoin Core. You can control the max block weight with `-blockmaxweight` (default is 3996000 WU). Also, F2Pool is known for running with custom patches on top of Bitcoin Core to maximize fees: e.g. they reduced the number of sigops reserved for the coinbase. This [bit them twice](https://twitter.com/0xB10C/status/1643871608401014785) a few months ago due to not keeping that patch up-to-date.\r\n\r\nEnd of last year, Poolin also mined blocks with more than the default max block weight. See for example [762816](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/00000000000000000002373c6610fe88ca7a48023a7ffac351f1ff388dea93cb). The EclipseMC pool mined a few, for example, [752015](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/00000000000000000006e05b1e14860d33517d10bad0cf38f62aa452c1365bd2), the Huobi Pool with e.g. [710871](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/0000000000000000000451109149b22d6716fd1c9200c08ee295b0c6b6d82d28), and the KuCoin Pool too with, for example, [751909](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/000000000000000000063efdbd724ae035ce4b56d512a041ad2bd139374152ff).",

      "body": "TIL about this, despite having authored #30356.\r\n\r\nI think `-blockmaxweight` should refer to the actual worst case block, i.e. assuming the pool uses all 4000 WU. So its default should be equal to `MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT`. It's documentation should clarify this.\r\n\r\nWe do need to make sure that if a miner has been setting `-blockmaxweight=4000000` manually, nothing breaks.\r\n\r\nAn additional argument for having `-blockmaxweight` not adjust for the reservation, is that in Stratum v2 each connected Template Provider (i.e. a pool or an individual miner making its own templates) can specify how much space to reserve. So `4000` only applies to `getblocktemplate` users, whereas `-blockmaxweight` applies everywhere.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have a functional test for this.\r\n\r\nSome history:\r\n\r\n`MAX_BLOCK_COST` was initially introduced for a setting called `-blockmaxcost` as part of the main SegWit pull request #8149. It existed alongside `-blockmaxsize` and was effectively a way to limit the amount of witness data.\r\n\r\nAt the time `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_SIZE` was `750000`, i.e. 3/4th of the maximum size. So `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT` was set to 3 million, 3/4th of the maximum weight.\r\n\r\nLater on the combination of #8363 and #11100 replaced the confusing `MAX_BLOCK_COST`, `-blockmaxsize` and `-blockmaxcost` by just `DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT` and `-blockmaxweight`. That first PR kept the 3/4th of the maximum default.\r\n\r\nThe second PR #11100 changed the default to 4 million. It also introduced the 4000 adjustment. Unfortunately increasing the default caused a bunch of arguing, which probably didn't aid in review.\r\n\r\nHowever the mistake _was_ caught in review, but considered not to be a big deal:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11100#discussion_r135124178 (PR description also links to this comment)\r\n\r\nI do think we should fix this, because the alternative is that people start patching this stuff themselves and make very expensive mistakes.

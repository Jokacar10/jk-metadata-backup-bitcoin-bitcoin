It could iterate over the utxo set for the check and then instruct for a `rescan` to restore missing transaction history and balance, if two different balances were calculated.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28897\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

Moreover, on hardware without parallel cores, building the block filter index is not going to be sped up. Finally, on wallets with a sufficient number of keys, the blockfilter rescan may take longer than a \"traditional\" rescan, or at least time in the same magnitude.",

      "body": "> the rescan won't find the txs if the birthdate is wrong\r\n\r\nThe birth time check resides on the 'block connected' event handler. It does not affect the `rescanblockchain` functionality. Users can utilize it to identify missing transactions.\r\n\r\n> see also #28897\r\n\r\nFixed it few days ago, see #28920.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, on hardware without parallel cores, building the block filter index is not going to be sped up\r\n\r\nThat's true, but it's not a reason not to do it. The entire node is multi-threaded, and the user will need to call `rescanblockchain` sooner or later to obtain the latest wallet state (use missing tx outputs, see the final balance, etc.)\r\n\r\nI'm not going against your proposed changes (the  `getbalances scan_utxoset=true` sounds good for me). But, just as a clarification; the user will still need to call `rescanblockchain` **after** calling `getbalances` to detect the transaction(s) history and any other possible branches of it.\r\nFor instance, could be a case where the spendable utxo is part of a chain of transactions, so the wallet will need to scan the chain backwards. Which could also cause the wallet to surpass the look-ahead window (the 1k key pool), which could make the wallet identify other transactions along the way.",

When enabled, the wallet generates its scriptPubKeys and compares them against the chain’s UTXO set to compute UTXO set based balance. This balance is then compared with the wallet’s trusted balance. If the two match, the import proceeds as normal. If a discrepancy is found, the wallet automatically attempts incremental rescans in chunks of recent blocks until the missing history is located. On pruned nodes, these rescans do not go earlier than the prune boundary.\nThe RPC also returns additional diagnostic information when scan_utxoset is used, under a new info object. This includes whether the UTXO set matched the wallet balance (`utxo_check`), the number of incremental rescans attempted (`scanned_chunks`), and the approximate number of blocks scanned during incremental rescans (`scanned_blocks`).",

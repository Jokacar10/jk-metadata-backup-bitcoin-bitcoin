    "body": "Hello Bitcoin Core Maintainers,\n\nI’ve discovered a high-impact, multi-stage vulnerability chain that affects the CI/CD pipeline and trust chain of Bitcoin Core. The potential financial and systemic risk, if exploited, is critical and affects build integrity, wallet safety, and release trust.\n\nI have already sent a private disclosure request to `security@bitcoincore.org` but have not yet received acknowledgment.\n\nDue to the severity of the issue, I am requesting urgent coordination via a secure channel (PGP or ProtonMail). I will not be posting any technical details here, and I am committed to responsible disclosure.\n\nPlease advise on next steps or confirm receipt so I can proceed with the secure report.\n\nBest,  ",

But if you're not the person handling billion-dollar threat mitigations, I kindly ask you to step aside and let someone qualified respond.\n\nThis is a coordinated, ethical disclosure with real risk.

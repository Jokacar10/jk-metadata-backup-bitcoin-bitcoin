    "body": "Hello Bitcoin Core Maintainers,\n\nI’ve discovered a high-impact, multi-stage vulnerability chain that affects the CI/CD pipeline and trust chain of Bitcoin Core. The potential financial and systemic risk, if exploited, is critical and affects build integrity, wallet safety, and release trust.\n\nI have already sent a private disclosure request to `security@bitcoincore.org` but have not yet received acknowledgment.\n\nDue to the severity of the issue, I am requesting urgent coordination via a secure channel (PGP or ProtonMail). I will not be posting any technical details here, and I am committed to responsible disclosure.\n\nPlease advise on next steps or confirm receipt so I can proceed with the secure report.\n\nBest,  ",

But if you're not the person handling billion-dollar threat mitigations, I kindly ask you to step aside and let someone qualified respond.\n\nThis is a coordinated, ethical disclosure with real risk. I’ll continue waiting for a professional reply through official channels.\n\nThanks. @kanzure ",

Just a researcher trying to do the right thing through responsible disclosure.  \nThe rest of your assumptions are as inaccurate as they are unnecessary.\n\nIf you’re seeing every attempt to coordinate securely as spam, and every ethical move as suspicious, then perhaps you’re part of the problem — not the solution.\n\nYou’ve misrepresented facts. You’ve mocked someone avoiding public leaks. And now you're nitpicking numbers to discredit a disclosure you haven't even seen.\n\nThis isn’t about your ego or your guesswork.\n\nThis is about a threat you can’t quantify — because you're too busy trying to win a thread instead of securing a network.\n\nSo here’s a challenge:  \nIf you truly believe you understand the technical risk, then explain it.  \nIf not? Then step back, and let the professionals handle what matters.\n\nI didn’t come here to argue with noise. I came here to stop a billion-dollar breach before it happens.\n\nDon’t be the reason it slips through.\n\n– The researcher you're lucky spoke up at all. @kanzure ",

There was no request for my PGP fingerprint or key because no human has replied to coordinate.\n\nYou keep pushing the narrative that this is about \"believability.\"  \nThis is not a personal trust issue. It's a technical one — and one that's being mishandled publicly because of your repeated interventions.\n\nAccusing someone of using LLMs is your latest deflection. I could have written this with crayons — the content still matters.\n\nIf you truly represent the security team, coordinate professionally.  \nIf you don’t, then kindly stop derailing what was a clean attempt to disclose a major vulnerability through proper channels.\n\nYour involvement has gone from confusing… to obstructive.\n\n– A researcher who’s tired of explaining professionalism to someone who keeps missing the point. @kanzure At this point, the only inconsistency I see is your inability to decide whether you're a reviewer, a gatekeeper, or just someone who doesn’t like not being the smartest person in the room.\n",

      "body": "Let’s get something straight — both technically and ethically.\n\n1. The issue reported was a **multi-stage CI/CD supply chain vulnerability**, not a syntax error or user complaint.  \n   Dismissing it without technical review is a breach of every responsible disclosure principle in open source security.\n\n2. The claim that “CI/CD cannot affect release builds” is not only inaccurate — it’s dangerously naive.  \n   CI/CD affects everything *before* deterministic builds:  \n   - Code review gates  \n   - Merge pipelines  \n   - Pre-merge verification  \n   - Contributor trust chain  \n   - Third-party integrations (wallets, exchanges, etc.)\n\n   If CI was irrelevant, adversaries wouldn’t target it. Ask SolarWinds.\n\n3. PGP keys *were* used. No response came from security@bitcoincore.org. That’s not “inconsistency” — it’s silence.\n\n4. Bryan: Mocking responsible disclosure with “LLM” accusations and nitpicking email headers doesn’t make you right — it makes you part of the problem.  \n   Your entire approach has been one of arrogance, not security. You don’t speak for the project, and you certainly don’t speak for the users at risk.\n\n5. Ava: Marking a disclosure like this as “Completed” — without secure coordination, without technical assessment, and without review of the proof — is a cover-up, not a resolution.  \n   If anything, your response will be documented as a failure of process, not an example of it.\n\nSecurity isn’t a checkbox, a GitHub comment, or a title.  \nIt’s how you handle risk *before it explodes*.\n\n– A researcher who offered a chance to fix this quietly. You chose otherwise. @kanzure @achow101 ",

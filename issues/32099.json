    "title": "Add a `indexesdir` option to hold the indexes directory",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nAn `indexesdir` option (or whatever you want to call it) to specify an alternative directory to datadir to hold the 'indexes' subdirectory, like the `blocksdir` option for the 'blocks' subdirectory.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nLike the 'blocks' directory, the 'indexes' directory can grow to a significant size (perhaps not as large as 'blocks' but still significantly large), making it desirable to e.g. offload it onto a separate HDD while keeping the rest of datadir on an SSD for other benefits (like fast access to the chainstate directory). This option is already available for the 'blocks' directory through the `blocksdir` option, so there's adequate precedent to do the same for 'indexes'.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nDescribed above\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n[Splitting datadir using symlinks etc](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Splitting_the_data_directory)\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

Running instead _with_ `-txindex` would indeed bump internal/primary storage up to around 10-12%, which may be what you're seeing.. \n\nDon't know if it would help your situation, but have you tried running w/o `-txindex`?",

    "title": "contrib: Automation for Bitcoin Full Node Deployment",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\nI followed the [Bitcoin Full Node installation guide](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node). While the guide is thorough, it lacks automation, which can lead to human errors and platform compatibility issues during manual deployment.\r\n\r\nI propose adding an automation contrib for seamless deployment and maintenance of a Bitcoin full node. This will help eliminate manual errors, improve consistency across environments, simplify the overall process, and reduce the time and effort required for setup and maintenance.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nYes, this issue is related to the problem of manual setups and their failure risks.\r\nManual setup is useful to understand the step-by-step setup process, but it is no longer reliable in production environments.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n1.  **Docker**: Docker image for Bitcoin Core binaries. I started [here](https://github.com/0xawaz/bitcoin/tree/0xawaz_docker/contrib/docker). I would love feedback before converting it to a PR.\r\n3.  **Ansible Playbooks**: Ansible playbooks to setup instance, install dependencies, build docker image and run bitcoin core container. We want to support bare metal and cloud instances.\r\n4.  **Monitoring System**: Prometheus/Grafana monitoring system to monitor Bitcoin Node metrics and health.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI automated the setup for myself, as the manual setup wasn't convenient. I want to share it with the bitcoin community.\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nI read [contribution policy](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b21ba081be89a6716cce91d8a01b8c0abe9c77a3/CONTRIBUTING.md). I am not sure if this is the right repo for this contribution, if so, I am happy to start creating related PRs, if not, please direct me where I can share it with bitcoin community :)",

Do you need more hands in the team or do you need us to adapt to the Bitcoin Core build environment and CI/CD process?\r\n  - To be able to succeed where previous attempts failed, I will need to dig more in the code, CI/CD workflows, and tricky blind spots I need to consider ... Will you be willing to provide me with more information about your concerns and experience with Dockerfile attempts integrations?

Not sure how much actual interest is there, given that no one has done so far, or the previous attempts were seemingly abandoned?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think everything has been said in all previous discussions of this topic over the past decade, so I don't think it makes sense to re-hash everything every two years.

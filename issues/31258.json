    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nRPC that allows generating addresses from a given silent payment address.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nThis RPC could help application developers that use bitcoin core RPC in different projects to generate new addresses from a given silent payment address.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n[`getnewaddress`](https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/28.0.0/rpc/wallet/getnewaddress/) could have a new argument for silent payment address and it should generate new address from it.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n- Get multiple addresses\r\n- Get XPUB\r\n\r\nCouldn't find any libraries that could help in generating bitcoin addresses from silent payment address.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nThis pull request could help in adding this RPC: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201",

      "body": "Given that computing the actual output script in a transaction paying to a silent payments address requires knowing the exact inputs and having the private keys for those inputs, I don't think this will really be possible in an ergonomic way, and any way to implement this is very footgun-y. The taproot address is entirely dependent on the inputs used so the receiver does not necessarily know that they have been paid if you just send to any taproot address computed from a silent payments address. This can potentially result in loss of funds.",

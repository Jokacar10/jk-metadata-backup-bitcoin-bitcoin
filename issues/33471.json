    "title": "Inconsistent CJDNS address handling in Local addresses and AddLocal logs",
    "body": "When running:\n\n```bash\n./build/bin/bitcoind -daemon -server=1 -onion=127.0.0.1:9050 -externalip=<hostname_addr> -listen -cjdnsreachable\n```\n\nonly two Tor addresses appear under _Local addresses_ and no CJDNS addresses in `bitcoin-cli -netinfo 4`. The log also shows two `AddLocal(...)` entries for the onion address, but none for the CJDNS address. However, adding a CJDNS peer via `addnode ... add` works as expected.\n\nIn contrast, running:\n\n```\n./build/bin/bitcoind -daemon -listen -cjdnsreachable\n```\n\nshows one Tor address and one CJDNS address in _Local addresses_. The log also includes one `AddLocal(...)` for the onion address and one for the CJDNS address, and peer addition works normally.\n\nThis seems inconsistent: in the first case, shouldnâ€™t the CJDNS address also appear in _Local addresses_ and be logged with `AddLocal(<cjdns_addr>)`?",

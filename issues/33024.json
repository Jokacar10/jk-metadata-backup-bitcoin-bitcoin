    "title": "Security Disclosure Mishandled by Bitcoin Core Maintainers",
    "body": "Summary:\nA serious coordinated disclosure of a CI/CD vulnerability chain impacting Bitcoin Core trust infrastructure was submitted responsibly, but met with the following:\n\n- Dismissive behavior\n- Public mockery of the researcher\n- False technical claims downplaying CI/CD threat\n- Closure of the GitHub issue without technical evaluation\n\n#### Who was involved:\n- **@achow101 (Ava Chow)** closed the issue without PoC review, discussion, or coordination.\n- **@kanzure (Bryan Bishop)** mocked the disclosure, questioned the researcher's credibility, and injected irrelevant LLM accusations â€” instead of addressing technical risk.\n\n#### Why this matters:\nBitcoin's strength lies in its **trust chain**. CI/CD is not some optional layer â€” itâ€™s the heart of review, merge, and verification processes.  \nAny compromise here affects:\n\n- Pre-merge testing\n- Contributor approval paths\n- Verification infrastructure\n- Downstream consumers: wallets, exchanges, custodians\n\nDismissing this is not just technically ignorant â€” itâ€™s dangerous.\n\n#### Timeline:\n\n- ðŸ“… July 20, 2025 â€“ Initial disclosure sent via `security@bitcoincore.org`\n- ðŸ“… July 20, 2025 â€“ Issue opened on GitHub\n- ðŸ“… Bryan intervenes, dismisses, and mocks the disclosure\n- ðŸ“… Ava closes the issue with \"Completed\" without PoC or review\n- ðŸ“… Still no direct technical contact or secure channel offered\n\n#### Researcher Statement:\n> I disclosed this issue privately and professionally.\n> I expected maturity, not mockery.\n> This post is not for attention â€” itâ€™s to protect an ecosystem that deserves better gatekeepers.\n\n#### Request:\n- Public acknowledgment of mishandling\n- Re-opening of a secure coordination channel (PGP)\n- Engagement with maintainers who respect ethical disclosure\n\nâ€”  \n**Researcher: Alex Morgan**  \nThis issue will remain public as a case study in how not to respond to critical vulnerabilities. @kanzure @achow101 ",

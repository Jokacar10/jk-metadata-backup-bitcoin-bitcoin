    "title": "Higher **reported** memory usage of Bitcoin Core after version 29",
    "body": "For versions of Bitcoin Core after 29.0, common utilities like `top` will report higher RAM usage of the `bitcoind` process than for previous Bitcoin Core versions.\n\nThe size of LevelDB files was increased from 2 MiB to 32 MiB in Bitcoin Core 29.0 (PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30039). LevelDB caches its on-disk files using [`mmap`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap) and will cache up to 1000 files by default, although our fork increased this number to 4096 (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb-subtree/pull/52). This means that if there is enough available memory, the full chainstate database will be cached.\n\nHowever this is not memory actually *used* by the `bitcoind` process, only on-disk database files cached for faster future reads. Therefore in case of memory pressure, the host's kernel will not kill the `bitcoind` process but just drop the `mmap` pages. To be extra clear: **although common utilities will report that Bitcoin Core after 29.0 uses more memory it is not so and it will not lead to OOM**.",

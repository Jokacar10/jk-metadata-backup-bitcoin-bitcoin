Looking up the \"Broken pipe\" error, it also seems like that can only be triggered if something is closing the `EventLoop::m_wait_fd` file descriptor before the `write(m_post_fd, ...)` call happens. But I don't see a code path where that would happen. May need to reproduce locally to debug. Would be curious to know if this happens more.",

If I do that I tend to see the crash after 20-30 minutes of looping the test. I also tried implementing a change to dump IPC debug logs from the child `bitcoin-node` processs that is spawned during the test, but unfortunately this change made the problem disappear when the test was run in a loop overnight, so I don't have great information about what is leading up and causing the child process to crash,\n\n<details><summary>diff</summary>\n<p>\n\n```diff\n@@ -32,6 +33,9 @@

calling `EventLoop::removeClient`:\n\nhttps://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/3b2617b3e59f55ae3501c82a62c87f393077779f/src/mp/proxy.cpp#L260\n\nwhich is failing when it tries to write to `EventLoop::m_post_fd`:\n\nhttps://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/3b2617b3e59f55ae3501c82a62c87f393077779f/src/mp/proxy.cpp#L242\n\nbut as mentioned earlier https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31151#issuecomment-2444255035, it's not clear why that write would ever fail because the pipe should be open for reading at that point. Since I couldn't easily add more log prints, I tried looking at surrounding code for reference counting-bugs, to see if there was any shutdown sequence that might lead to stopping the event loop early and closing the pipe, but I couldn't find anything. Looking at the EventLoop thread I did see some cases where locks for `EventLoop::m_mutex` are missing, so I will try to add those and see if that helps. If it doesn't and I might try to add delays different places to see if I can get the bug to happen more reliably. I also need to try building libmultiprocess code with -fsanitize=thread (regardless of this bug), since there might be other issues it could catch.",

      "body": "I think I figured out how the [` wait_stream = nullptr;`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/3b2617b3e59f55ae3501c82a62c87f393077779f/src/mp/proxy.cpp#L211) statement in `EventLoop::loop` is happening before the [`write(m_post_fd, ...)`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/3b2617b3e59f55ae3501c82a62c87f393077779f/src/mp/proxy.cpp#L242) call in `EventLoop::removeClient` called by the thread in `EventLoop::startAsyncThread`, which is causing the error about trying to write to a closed pipe.\n\nThe issue is that the event loop can exit early, after it has detected the loop ending condition [`m_num_clients == 0 && m_async_fns.empty()`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/3b2617b3e59f55ae3501c82a62c87f393077779f/src/mp/proxy.cpp#L204), but before the `write(m_post_fd, ...)` call is made to notify the loop that the ending condition has been reached.\n\nSpecifically, this can happen in the `~Connection` destructor when it calls [`startAsyncThread && removeClient`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/3b2617b3e59f55ae3501c82a62c87f393077779f/src/mp/proxy.cpp#L109-L110). Depending on what order the destructor thread and the async thread run, it is possible that the [`removeClient`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/3b2617b3e59f55ae3501c82a62c87f393077779f/src/mp/proxy.cpp#L234-L245) call in the destructor runs first and detects `m_num_clients == 0` and calls `write(m_post_fd, ...)`, but (importantly) the event loop does not read from the other end of the pipe right away. Then the async thread calls `addClient` and `removeClient` as it is executing the `m_async_fns` queue, and (also importantly) the final `removeClient` call it makes is interrupted after it runs  `m_num_clients -= 1` but before it runs `write(m_post_fd, ...)`. When this happens, `EventLoop::loop` thread can wake up, read from the other end of the pipe because of the `write(m_post_fd, ...)` call that happened earlier, and exit the loop before the second `write(m_post_fd, ...)` has a chance to run, resulting in a write error.\n\nThat's the sequence of events that I think is happening in this case, but there are other sequences possible that could have the same effect. For example, if the `m_async_fns` list has multiple entries (this could happen with multiple connections) and the async thread makes multiple `removeClient` and `write(m_post_fd, ...)` calls, and earlier writes are not read right away, and the thread is interrupted before the final `write(m_post_fd, ...)` call, the loop can exit, causing the final write to fail trying to write to a closed pipe.\n\nFundamentally the problem here is that are multiple `write(m_post_fd, ...)` calls being made at all. If the `removeClient` [`if (m_num_clients == 0)`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/3b2617b3e59f55ae3501c82a62c87f393077779f/src/mp/proxy.cpp#L238) check were changed to `if (m_num_clients == 0 && m_async_fns.empty())` I think this problem would not happen.\n\nA second issue with this code is that [`if (m_num_clients == 0 && m_async_fns.empty())`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/3b2617b3e59f55ae3501c82a62c87f393077779f/src/mp/proxy.cpp#L204) loop exit check in `EventLoop::loop` is unsafe because it is made without holding an `m_mutex` lock, which could cause a race resulting in the same error reported here, if loop exit happens early because it is based on stale values.\n\nUsing `-fsanitize=thread` helped uncover both these issues. It uncovered the second issue right away, but after I fixed the second issue, it only reported the first issue if I ran a test calling `node.echoipc` and `self.stop_node` in a loop thousands of times that had to run around ~30 minutes before a race would be triggered and TSAN would report something. TSAN output was also a bit confusing because it referred to the `write()` call as a read and the `close()` call as a write, but that does makes sense given TSAN's [file descriptor](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerPopularDataRaces#race-on-a-file-descriptor) race [detection](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerDetectableBugs), since conceptually a `write()` call does not mutate a file descriptor but a `close()` does. I also wasted a lot of time trying to suppress that error report with `AnnotateHappensBefore` and `AnnotateHappensAfter` by trying to add a HappensBefore call after the pipe write call, and a HappensAfter call after the pipe read call, but this did not suppress it. Eventually I moved the HappensAfter call right before the `close()` call and this did suppress the error. Then at some point after that I realized that multiple writes could trigger a real race condition and the TSAN error maybe should not be suppressed.\n\nI think next step will be to make a multiprocess PR adding an EventLoop::done method to check for the `m_num_clients == 0 && m_async_fns.empty()` condition consistently so there should only ever be a single write triggering a shutdown and no way for the event loop to exit before the write happens. This should also fix the missed `m_mutex` problem. Separately another PR might add TSAN HappensBefore/HappensAfter annotations if TSAN detects errors, since TSAN doesn't actually have a way of knowing the pipe write must happen before the code that runs after the pipe read.\n\nMaybe there are CI improvements that could be made too. After #30975 it would make sense to build libmultiprocess with  `-fsanitize=thread` in the tsan build. And it would be nice if core dumps could be enabled on CI and GDB were run on any core dumps that were produced to output a backtrace.",

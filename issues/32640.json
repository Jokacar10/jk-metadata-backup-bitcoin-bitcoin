    "title": "Bug in PartiallyDownloadedBlock fuzz test logic or behavior",
    "body": "There may be a bug in the fuzz test implementation for `PartiallyDownloadedBlock` in `src/test/fuzz/partially_downloaded_block.cpp`. Please investigate the following:\n\n- The fuzz test performs various operations relating to compact blocks and partial downloads, including marking transactions as available, manipulating mempool/extra_txn, and reconstructing blocks.\n- It uses assertions to check the state after calling `InitData` and `FillBlock` on `PartiallyDownloadedBlock`.\n- The test may not properly handle some edge cases or error conditions, especially with regard to skipped/missing transactions or with the mock check block logic.\n\nPlease review the fuzz test logic for correctness, robustness, and potential failure to catch certain classes of errors, especially around:\n- Handling of skip/missing transactions and the related assertions\n- The assignment or logic in `check_block_mock`\n- Any cases where the test could pass erroneously or fail to catch regressions\n\nAdditional context may be required depending on the specific bug observed or the test coverage intended.\n",

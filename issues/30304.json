    "title": "ci: Move more tasks to GHA?",
    "body": "Motivated by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29274 to make it easier to run the CI on forks, more tasks could be moved to GHA, similar to d97ddbe797f5b8b3bca0ee71b692e542b8990195?\r\n\r\nThe downside would be that it is harder to re-run a task (only maintainers can do it, not the pull request author).\r\n\r\nAnother downside would be that caching depends artefacts and docker images is hard on GHA. So ideally only tasks with `NO_DEPENDS=1` are moved for now. It would be:\r\n\r\n* `ci/test/00_setup_env_native_fuzz.sh:export NO_DEPENDS=1`\r\n* `ci/test/00_setup_env_native_tidy.sh:export NO_DEPENDS=1`\r\n\r\nAny other thoughts, or volunteers to move the tasks?",

      "body": "I actually meant to ask this in #30193, but why do we cache using run-id in the key `${{ github.job }}-ccache-${{ github.run_id }}` ? As we only cache on master, using only `${{ github.job }}-ccache` would make more sense to me; a single rolling cache per job.\r\n\r\nWhen we search for the cache to load we use a \"wildcard\" restore `restore-keys: ${{ github.job }}-ccache-` (with no run_id).\r\n\r\nThis would remove some \"duplicates\", e.g \"macos-native-x86_64-ccache-\" has 3 cache entries, when it only needs 1?\r\n\r\nAm I missing some reason for doing things this way?",

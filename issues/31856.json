    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nPR #23471 added a note to [ZMQ's documentation page](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md) saying that:\n\n> […] 32-byte hashes are in Little Endian and not in the Big Endian format that the RPC interface and block explorers use to display transaction and block hashes.\n\nAlso:\n\n> `| hashtx | <32-byte transaction hash in Little Endian> | <uint32 sequence number in Little Endian>`\n> `| hashblock | <32-byte block hash in Little Endian> | <uint32 sequence number in Little Endian>`\n\nHowever, unless I am missing something, transaction and block hashes in both ZMQ and RPC appear in the same, reversed byte order (big endian).\n\nIf this is confirmed, I would like to prepare PR for the documentation.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nDocumentation would not contain references to hashes being in Little Endian.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nStart regtest with ZMQ hashblock:\n\n```sh\nbitcoind -regtest -datadir=zmqtest -server --daemon -zmqpubhashblock=tcp://0.0.0.0:43441\nbitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=zmqtest createwallet \"\"\n```\n\nRun independent ZMQ client in Python:\n\n```python\n  import zmq\n  import binascii\n\n  context = zmq.Context()\n  socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB)\n\n  socket.connect(\"tcp://localhost:43441\")\n  socket.setsockopt_string(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, \"hashblock\")\n\n  topic = socket.recv()\n  data = socket.recv()\n  seq = socket.recv()\n\n  print(f\"Topic: {topic}\")\n  print(f\"Data:  {binascii.hexlify(data)}\")\n  print(f\"Seq:   {binascii.hexlify(seq)}\")\n```\n\nGenerate block:\n\n```sh\nbitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=zmqtest -generate 1\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"address\": \"bcrt1qpjy0a3ply66pwpj6mp8sn36aslwr3gvdq727v6\",\n  \"blocks\": [\n    \"4f36a8e4e1ff6ebcc13f6bec62841e44a8b4c281f1f1346f148987735fb72e0e\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOutput of ZMQ client:\n\n```\nTopic: b'hashblock'\nData:  b'4f36a8e4e1ff6ebcc13f6bec62841e44a8b4c281f1f1346f148987735fb72e0e'\nSeq:   b'00000000'\n```\n\nCalculate hash of the block header to crosscheck:\n\n```sh\n  header=$(bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=zmqtest getblockheader 4f36a8e4e1ff6ebcc13f6bec62841e44a8b4c281f1f1346f148987735fb72e0e false)\n  echo $header | xxd -r -p | sha256sum | xxd -r -p | sha256sum\n```\n\n```\n0e2eb75f738789146f34f1f181c2b4a8441e8462ec6b3fc1bc6effe1e4a8364f  -\n```\n\n`0e2eb75f738789146f34f1f181c2b4a8441e8462ec6b3fc1bc6effe1e4a8364f` ← hash in natural order (output of SHA256; little endian)\n`4f36a8e4e1ff6ebcc13f6bec62841e44a8b4c281f1f1346f148987735fb72e0e` ← hash in reversed order (ZMQ, RPC; big endian)\n\n---\n\nI assume hashes are printed by `GetHex()`. The bytes are printed in reversed order:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/55cf39e4c54da6639a8f1f7c813c2909454cada1/src/uint256.cpp#L10-L18\n\nTo ZMQ, they are also sent in reversed order:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/55cf39e4c54da6639a8f1f7c813c2909454cada1/src/zmq/zmqpublishnotifier.cpp#L220-L229\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPackage manager\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\n28.0.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nArch Linux, 6.12\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

Relevant ZMQ code is [Lines 220 to 240 in zmqpublishnotifier.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c242fa5be358150d83c2446896b6f4c45c6365e9/src/zmq/zmqpublishnotifier.cpp#L220-L240) and the ZMQ documentation cited is pretty wrong or at least misleading:\n\n> […] 32-byte hashes are in Little Endian and not in the Big Endian format that the RPC interface and block explorers use to display transaction and block hashes. [...]\n>\n> `| hashtx | <32-byte transaction hash in Little Endian> | <uint32 sequence number in Little Endian>`\n> `| hashblock | <32-byte block hash in Little Endian> | <uint32 sequence number in Little Endian>`\n\nThe most straightforward way to think about hashtx and hashblock values is as byte arrays, not as numbers. And ZMQ and RPC both interface return the same reversed byte arrays (with bytes produced by the original hash functions in reverse order). So current ZMQ documentation is wrong to describe ZMQ and RPC interfaces as being inconsistent.\n\nSince the RPC interface returns the byte array as strings in hex format, you can interpret these strings as hexadecimal numbers, and these are the same numbers you would get if you interpreted output of the hash functions as little-endian numbers. So current ZMQ documentation is mostly wrong describe RPC interface as using big endian format, though if you squint maybe you could say it is right because the RPC interface is sending the numbers in a big endian byte representation that it previously happened to decode from a little-endian byte representation.\n\nThe ZMQ documentation is also maybe somewhat right to describe its own output as little-endian, because similar to the RPC if you just display the ZMQ output as hex, you will see numbers that match little a endian interpretation of hash function outputs. But it is also misleading because actual bytes produced by ZMQ are definitely a big-endian not a little-endian representation of those numbers.\n\nBest way to fix this would be to avoid using terms little endian and big endian at all and just say ZMQ outputs bytes of tx and block hashes, with bytes reversed, which is the same way they are shown in the RPC interface.",

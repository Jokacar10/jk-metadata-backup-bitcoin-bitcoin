    "title": "Running out of memory on a 2GB box - Initializing chainstate Chainstate [ibd] @ height -1 (null)",
    "body": "I have a server running a pruned bitcoind node as a Docker container with 2G RAM. There are some other services using maybe 500MB of the RAM but I got into a state where bitcoind tries to initialize the chainstate but then starts sucking up all the available RAM so it gets killed with OOM error. Docker then restarts it and it loops like this forever\r\n\r\nI tried to configure bitcoind to be constrained to low memory but it doesn't seem to have any effect\r\n\r\n```\r\n[main]\r\nprinttoconsole=1\r\nrpcallowip=::/0\r\nrpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0\r\nprune=550\r\ntxindex=0\r\nrpcport=8332\r\nrpcbind=0.0.0.0:8332\r\ndbcache=20\r\nmaxmempool=5\r\nmaxconnections=32\r\n\r\nassumevalid=00000000000000000002923a7456aa3d4adce139cd16550c3ff36d07cc45d251\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis node did successfully complete IBD at one point and it is unknown exactly why or when it got into this OOM loop. Maybe it has something to do with the assumevalid? In fact the way this docker container was constructed is that on every restart it would get the latest block hash from an esplora server and set that hash to assumevalid in bitcoin.conf before initializing. So I am theorizing that maybe this unusual behavior created some sort of data that needs to be fully loaded into memory before proceeding and so it gets killed.\r\n\r\nBelow are the logs of a typical startup of bitcoind at this point. I have tried locking the hash of assumevalid and disabled the esplora auto-update logic but it didn't have any effect.\r\n\r\nAs a last resort I will clear out the chainstate and try to do IBD again but am trying to surgically fix it if possible. Decided to open an issue here in case there is some edge case optimization to prevent bitcoind from having to eat up 1.5GB of memory.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are appreciated and feel free to close if there is nothing actionable and this all just came down to a misuse of `assumevalid`. Thanks!\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoind-1  | 2024-12-27T15:00:16Z Bitcoin Core version v26.0.0 (release build)\r\nbitcoind-1  | 2024-12-27T15:00:16Z Using the 'sse4(1way),sse41(4way),avx2(8way)' SHA256

Essentially the same as: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/28.x/configure.ac#L298\r\n\r\nSo basically the user will always get -O2, unless they change the optims by setting them in the supported/documented variable: `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE=-O3`\r\n\r\nSee here for the fix: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/4f8f7de25968dc3ca93798c84781b5413e41afdf\r\n\r\nI can PR ^^ if you're good with it.",

It would've been intentional.\n\nIt's a bit different with CMake because the default setting for the `Release` build type is `-O3`. Our default is `RelWithDebInfo` which sets `-O2`, but many guides recommend using `Release`, and it's safe to assume that many packagers will be doing so as well.\n\nCurrently we intercept flags for the `Release` type and downgrade to `-O2`.

      "body": "> Ignoring the current impl details, the main question to be answered here is: Do we consider `-O3` to be harmful/dangerous?\n\nIs it the case that the primary danger for us would be the compiler optimising out undefined behaviour? If so, then our compiler warnings and `native_asan` ci test which has the `undefined` sanitizer enabled should (in theory) catch said instances of UB?\n\n> Currently we intercept flags for the `Release` type and downgrade to `-O2`. This would be pretty unexpected behavior and unnecessary unless we believe that `-O3` is potentially harmful/dangerous.\n\nI think I might have the opposite view here, in that for our software specifically; that we *should* actively downgrade to \"known good\" configuration when users who are self-compiling will likely by-default choose `Release`, as you mention.\n\nAs far as I know, we can't claim we fully understand the implications of `-O3` on our codebase in terms of optimizations like:\n\n- Loop vectorization\n- More aggressive loop optimizations\n- Memory aliasing assumptions\n- etc.\n\nIn particular we will of course be most worried about `-O3` \"optimizing\" away cryptographic security checks, or inadvertently creating new side-channel attacks, etc.\n\nFor someone who knows what they are doing and really wants (to test?) `-O3`, it doesn't seem a lot of work to use our  [almost currently-documented](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md#memory-requirements) workaround:\n\n```bash\ncmake -B build -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO=\"-O3 -g\"\n\n<snip>\nC++ compiler flags .................... -Wthread-safety -Wthread-safety-analysis -O3 -g -Wall -Wextra -std=c++20 -fPIC -fdebug-prefix-map=/home/will/src/core/bitcoin/src=. -fmacro-prefix-map=/home/will/src/core/bitcoin/src=. -Wall -Wextra -Wgnu -Wformat -Wformat-security -Wvla -Wshadow-field -Wthread-safety -Wloop-analysis -Wredundant-decls -Wunused-member-function -Wdate-time -Wconditional-uninitialized -Woverloaded-virtual -Wsuggest-override -Wimplicit-fallthrough -Wunreachable-code -Wdocumentation -Wself-assign -Wundef -Wno-unused-parameter -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 -Wstack-protector -fstack-protector-all -fcf-protection=full -fstack-clash-protection\nLinker flags .......................... -Wthread-safety -Wthread-safety-analysis -O3 -g -Wall -Wextra -fuse-ld=mold -fstack-protector-all -fcf-protection=full -fstack-clash-protection -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -Wl,-z,separate-code -fPIE -pie\n```\n\nI also benchmarked `O2` vs `O3` using [benchcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin/pull/133) (where the `O3` build also included an `O3` build of libsecp), which found a partial IBD (block 800k -> 855k) using `-O3` to be at most 4% faster when running with a 32GB dbcache:\n\n```\n  O2 (base)\n  Time (mean ± σ):     885.754 s ±  4.830 s    [User: 761.173 s, System: 94.122 s]\n  Range (min … max):   881.841 s … 891.152 s    3 runs\n\n  O3 (head)\n  Time (mean ± σ):     852.058 s ±  8.978 s    [User: 731.521 s, System: 93.994 s]\n  Range (min … max):   843.264 s … 861.210 s    3 runs\n\n  Summary\n  head (bafb9b1e75c74a4a003a5e35ead50ea0b8a76018) ran\n    1.04 ± 0.01 times faster than base (57616211dc0aa0b3cc79cfb38340e1ebf3018a37)\n```\n\nAnd with a default dbcache of 450MB only a meagre 2% faster.\n\n```\n  O2 (base)\n  Time (mean ± σ):     1333.866 s ± 47.501 s    [User: 1026.961 s, System: 177.274 s]\n  Range (min … max):   1285.064 s … 1379.948 s    3 runs\n\n  O3 (head)\n  Time (mean ± σ):     1306.266 s ± 11.358 s    [User: 944.099 s, System: 170.093 s]\n  Range (min … max):   1294.300 s … 1316.897 s    3 runs\n\n  Summary\n  head (bafb9b1e75c74a4a003a5e35ead50ea0b8a76018) ran\n    1.02 ± 0.04 times faster than base (57616211dc0aa0b3cc79cfb38340e1ebf3018a37)\n```\n\nIn summary, for such a small potential maximum benefit, accepting the unknowns don't personally feel worth it to me. I think if the automatic downgrade and workaround can be documented, and a fix provided for the current `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE` [bug](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31491#issuecomment-2542140874), we would be in a nice conservative position, where advanced users can still build `Release` with `-O3` too, if they really want to, but otherwise we will override the flag for `Release`.\n\nPS. The binaries for the benchcoin run are available [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin/actions/runs/13333704986?pr=133) in case anyone would like to run their own tests with them.\n\nPPS. It seems that Linus as recently as 2022 still does not want to entertain the option of an `-O3` Kernel: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CA+55aFz2sNBbZyg-_i8_Ldr2e8o9dfvdSfHHuRzVtP2VMAUWPg@mail.gmail.com/ outside of manually setting special build flags (much like our current \"workaround\" described above).\n",

    "body": "The code [fails](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31388#issuecomment-3369255505) to compile using the [LLVM MinGW](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw) toolchain.\n\nWhen building with libc++ that has LWG 3430 [implemented](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/4761e74a276ee1f38596f4849daa9d633929f2ae), constructing `std::ifstream` or `std::ofstream` from an `fs::path` object triggers its implicit conversion to `std::string`. This behavior has been undesirable ever since `fs::path` was introduced. See, for example: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a33bd767a37dccf39a094d03c2f62ea81633410f/src/util/fs.h#L54-L55",

      "body": "What is the bug exactly?\n\nThe current description is confusing because it says \"constructing `std::ifstream` or `std::ofstream` from an `fs::path` object triggers its implicit conversion to `std::string`\". But there aren't any unsafe impilcit conversion from paths to strings, there is only a [safe implicit conversion](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/path/native.html) to the native string type.\n\nSo what is the bug? Are there compile errors on windows? Is this the concern? Would be good to say what the specific bug or expected behavior is.\n\n> > I guess this means any fs::path would have to be explicitly cast to a std::fs::path, which seems fine to do.\n> \n> This is one way of doing it.\n\nI don't understand this response. What are the other ways of doing it?\n\nI think it might be nice to add a helper method like `const std::filesystem_path& std_path() const { return *this; }` so explicit conversions do not need to be very verbose. But I'm not sure if this would address the issue being reported.\n\n> > I guess you are asking how to deal with the fs linter?\n\n> This, and something like `operator std::string() const = delete;` should be added to `fs::path`.\n\nWhat is the issue with the fs linter? What problem would this deleted operator solve? I could imagine it maybe being useful to trigger compile errors on unix if the code might fail to compile on windows? But again if this would address the issue or what exactly the issue is.",

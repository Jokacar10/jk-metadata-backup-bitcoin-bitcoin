    "body": "When there's multiple script paths we can spend, the wallet just (partially) signs all of them. We then pick the one with the lowest fees:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/321984705dbcc5982013c8cfb52389cf3f2e75f6/src/script/sign.cpp#L373-L389\n\nThe user may want to override this, e.g.:\n\n1. For privacy reasons they don't wish to reveal the less secure (but cheaper) fallback condition. \n2. Their co-signer software trips up if it sees something in the `taproot_script_path_sigs` it  can't handle (similar to e.g. https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin-new/pull/340)\n\n#32857 lets the user avoid script path spending altogether. Similarly it would be good if they can manually pick one. ",

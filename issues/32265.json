    "title": "Enable C++26 P3471 \"Standard Library Hardening\" ahead of time?",
    "body": "C++26 includes standard library hardening (P3471). Albeit Bitcoin Core uses C++20 as of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/51166559808c3528f148b5c0c38cb4481e536dd8/CMakeLists.txt#L74, the feature can be enabled in earlier versions of C++, according to https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3471r4.html#enabling-hardening. So the question is whether it should be done.\n\nSome benefits would be:\n\n* Less unsafe code, when preconditions are enforced by the standard library. This can help to find bugs, such as https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32122.\n* Less manual precondition checking, which is verbose and sometimes wrong. For example, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32255#issuecomment-2798728376.\n\nThe downsides would be:\n\n* The performance impact need to be checked. According to https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3471r4.html#deployment-experience, the impact was minimal at google in production when using libc++, except for some hot paths. However, the same may not be true for us, or for other standard libraries. For example, see a libstdc++ result here: https://www.github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31424#discussion_r1910658664. \n* There is no portable way to enable it for all standard libraries, so our build system would have to deal with it.\n\nFor now this is a brainstorming issue, to gather any benefits, downsides or questions that I've missed.\n\n",

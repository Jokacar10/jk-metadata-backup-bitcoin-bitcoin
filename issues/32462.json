    "title": "RFC: Should node Wallet Startup Options Apply to Individual Wallets?",
    "body": "PR #29278 is going to introduces a `maxfeerate` wallet startup option.\n\nThere was some discussion between  between @luke-jr , me, and @murchandamus in a thread https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29278#discussion_r1468533274\n\n> This still isn't a wallet option...\n\n> I don't understand why you said it is not a wallet option.\n> The `OptionsCategory` of this startup option is `WALLET`, and it's only used in the wallet.\n> Can you please expand on your comment?\n> Thanks.\n\n> I’m also confused by this comment. @luke-jr, could you elaborate on what you are suggesting?\n\n> Something set on each wallet, potentially different for each.\n\nLuke suggested that the startup option should instead be set individually for each wallet, rather than globally. \nHowever, this is not how the current wallet options are implemented wallet options are currently applied globally to all wallets.\n\nI'm opening this up for general discussion because I find it may be redundant to require setting the same options individually for each wallet.\nHowever, I’m curious to hear others' opinions.\n\n\n",

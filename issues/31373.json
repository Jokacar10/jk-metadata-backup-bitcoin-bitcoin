    "title": "RFC: support for writing UTXO set dump (`dumptxoutset` RPC) to a named pipe",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\nWhile the primary obvious use-case for the `dumptxoutset` RPC is to create AssumeUTXO snapshots (to be distributed and loaded on newly created nodes via the `loadtxoutset` RPC later), it can also be useful as input for external tooling like converters to other UTXO set formats, e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27432. For those, the intermediate step of writing a >10GB file to disk and then reading it again is wasteful and annoying, as it consumes both more time and space than necessary. By supporting writing to a [named pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe#In_Unix), the output data could be fed directly into another process instead. Thanks to the UNIX \"everything is a file\" philosophy, no logic changes in the tooling are even needed -- the reader only sees an input stream and doesn't notice or care if the input file represents an actual physical file on disk or if the data is generated on-the-fly from another process.\r\n\r\nCurrently needed steps for external tools:\r\n1. call `dumptxoutset` to create utxo.dump (>10GB on mainnet)\r\n2. call external tool with utxo.dump as input (run only after step 1 is finished)\r\n3. delete utxo.dump\r\n\r\nNeeded steps for external tools with named pipe support:\r\n1. create a named pipe utxo.pipe (e.g. via https://linux.die.net/man/3/mkfifo)\r\n2. call `dumptxoutset` to write to utxo.pipe\r\n3. call external tool with utxo.pipe as input (run in *parallel* to step 2)\r\n4. delete utxo.pipe\r\n\r\nI've tried this yesterday and it works as expected with minimal changes (see proposed solution below). Will push the branch later with concrete instructions, if people feel that this is worthwhile to support.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe `dumptxoutset` call only needs two minor behaviour modificiations. If the passed `path` is a named pipe (trivially detectable via C++ standard library routine [std::filesystem::is_fifo](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/is_fifo)), then:\r\n* don't error if the file already exists\r\n* don't create a temporary file with `.incomplete` suffix, but write directly into the specified path\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

My plan was to base the change on #27432 and then provide an additional mode where the user has to provide the path to the bitcoin-cli binary rather than an input file, which would roughly do the following:\r\n```\r\nfifoname=/tmp/txoutset.fifo\r\nbitcoincli_bin=$1\r\noutput_file=$2\r\nmkfifo $fifoname\r\n$bitcoincli_bin dumptxoutset $fifoname\r\n./contrib/utxo-tools/utxo-to-sqlite.py $fifoname $output_file\r\nrm $fifoname\r\n```\r\nWill open a PR shortly.",

      "body": "Hi @hebasto, My cmake version was 3.28.3.  I think(?) I generally followed the commands from the developer-notes.md link above:\n\nI did got a little \"off script\" and instead used the following cmake \"user\" preset for the clang tool chain with coverage reporting which should be just the same:\n   {\n      \"name\": \"my-coverage\",\n      \"displayName\": \"clang coverage mode build for testing\",\n      \"cacheVariables\": {\n        \"CMAKE_C_COMPILER\": \"clang\",\n        \"CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER\": \"clang++\",\n        \"CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS\": \"-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage\",\n        \"CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\": \"Coverage\",\n        \"BUILD_GUI\": \"OFF\",\n        \"WITH_BDB\": \"OFF\",\n        \"BUILD_BENCH\": \"OFF\",\n        \"BUILD_FOR_FUZZING\": \"OFF\",\n        \"BUILD_KERNEL_LIB\": \"OFF\",\n        \"BUILD_SHARED_LIBS\": \"OFF\",\n        \"BUILD_TESTS\": \"ON\",\n        \"BUILD_TX\": \"OFF\",\n        \"BUILD_UTIL\": \"OFF\",\n        \"BUILD_WALLET_TOOL\": \"OFF\"\n      }\n    }\nI was just trying to get my brain into cmake idioms, and user presets turned out to be useful for me as I did end up also making another one for profiling.  \nDetails for the cmake generate / build / test-drive steps follow:\n\n# Generate phase:\nexport srcDir=$HOME/lab/wkspc1/bitcoin\nexport buildDir=$HOME/lab/wkspc1/build/bitcoin\ncmake -S $srcDir -B $buildDir --fresh \\\n        --preset=my-coverage \\\n\n# Build phase:\ncmake --build  $buildDir \\\n\n# Test drive functional tests for coverage phase:\ncmake -P $buildDir/Coverage.cmake \n\nError happens here..\n\nI was not personally able to run the final \"Coverage.cmake\" without getting the reported error.  Digging into it, I made what I thought was the appropriate tweak to the top level project CMakeLists.txt to also push cov_tool_wrapper.in.sh to the cmake \"cache.\"  Looking now at the one line doco suggestion for the developer-noted.md, I am embarrassed to say it seems pretty silly to me now, like I was really getting too pedantic about cmake idioms I'm not yet fully qualified to opine on.  I'm very sorry about that, please ignore that part.\nCongratulations on the amazing work porting this project into cmake.\n",

      "body": "Yes to the first part; and good point, thank you, @mflcko.  The \"Coverage\" build type is currently ignored. \n\nScrolling up however please note needed:\n    \"CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS\": \"-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage\",\nllvm/clang tool chain compile flags are present and do work properly.\n\nMy apologies here; in retrospect, this issue is poorly titled.  The issue was **_not_** with compilation, but _**test execution**_ (for coverage).  Very sorry.  I should have been more careful with the title to this issue.  A better title to this issue would have been:\n\n> cmake -P $buildDir/Coverage.cmake: Functional test execution for coverage fails. Test wrapper resource \"cov_tool_wrapper.sh.in\" missing from build cache folder\n\nThat might have been much to the point.  Only if I make the suggested one line addition to CMakeLists.txt above am I personally able to generate test coverage HTML reports.  Thank you for the clarifying questions.\n\nSkimming above referenced [#31047](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31047) seems like a different break down with fuzzing, which was disabled here (please see the \"my-coverage\" user preset above).\n\nP.S.: I wouldn't think this issue is isolated to clang, but also problematic with gnu tool chain.  I reported it for clang, as that is where I saw it, but I suppose I should also try this with g++ & gcov for completeness?  And maybe also review the coverage with fuzzing issue referenced..",

Please note correct clang instrumentation for profiling specific CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS.\n\nThough I should have dropped \"CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\": \"Coverage\" from this issue to differentiate from [#31047](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31047).\n\nIn summary, I made two mistakes with this issue report:\n1. Conflating compile for coverage with test execution for coverage reporting.\n2. Accidentally introducing \"CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\": \"Coverage\" which is not fully fleshed out as I understand it.\n\nOverlooking these two mistakes, and with a better title, the issue report and suggested addition may otherwise be useful.  Thank you very much for the clarification questions, and I apologize for not wording this more carefully.",

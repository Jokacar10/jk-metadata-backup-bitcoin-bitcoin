    "title": "Proposal for Bitcoin Expiration Mechanism to Improve Scalability and Maintain Mining Incentives",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\n**Title**: Proposal for Bitcoin Expiration Mechanism to Improve Scalability and Maintain Mining Incentives\n\n**Summary:**\nThis proposal suggests implementing an expiration mechanism for unmoved Bitcoin to address long-term scalability, lost coins, and mining incentives. Under this model, Bitcoin that has remained unspent for a fixed period (e.g., 16 years) would be reabsorbed into the mining pool as block rewards, ensuring the blockchain remains sustainable while preserving the total supply cap of 21 million BTC.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nBitcoin faces two major long-term challenges:\n1. **Blockchain Growth**: The ledger size grows indefinitely, making it increasingly difficult for full nodes to operate efficiently.\n2. **Lost and Dormant Bitcoin**: A significant portion of Bitcoin is permanently lost due to forgotten keys, deaths, or lost hardware, reducing the functional supply.\n3. **Diminishing Mining Rewards**: As block rewards decrease over time, Bitcoin miners may lack sufficient incentive to secure the network.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n- **Expiration Rule**: Any Bitcoin UTXO that has remained unspent for a fixed period (e.g., 16 years) would be considered \"expired.\"\n- **Recycling Mechanism**: Expired Bitcoin would be reabsorbed and redistributed as future block rewards.\n- **Ledger Pruning**: Expired transactions would allow older blocks to be pruned, keeping the blockchain size stable.\n- **User Notification**: Wallet software would track UTXO expiration dates and notify users well in advance, ensuring they can move their funds if desired.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- **Fixed Blockchain Size**: Prevents excessive growth, making it feasible for more users to run full nodes.\n- **Preserves 21M BTC Cap**: The total Bitcoin supply remains unchanged, avoiding inflationary effects.\n- **Revives Lost BTC**: Reintroduces inactive Bitcoin back into circulation, improving liquidity.\n- **Sustains Mining Rewards**: Provides continuous incentives for miners long after the last Bitcoin is mined.\n- **Encourages Active Use**: Prevents excessive hoarding and ensures BTC remains a functional currency.\n\n**Potential Challenges & Considerations:**\n- **User Backlash**: Some may resist the idea of their Bitcoin expiring, even with ample warnings.\n- **Implementation Complexity**: Requires modifications to Bitcoin Core and consensus agreement.\n- **Security Risks**: Could this mechanism be exploited? Proper safeguards must be in place.\n- **Governance**: Defining the ideal expiration period (e.g., 16 years) requires broad consensus.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Community Feedback**: Open discussion with developers and users.\n2. **Technical Specification**: Draft a detailed BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal).\n3. **Testnet Implementation**: Create a fork or soft fork to test feasibility.\n4. **Consensus Building**: Work toward adoption by miners and node operators.\n\nThis proposal aims to enhance Bitcoin’s long-term viability while maintaining its core principles. Feedback and discussion are welcome to refine and improve the idea further.\n\n\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nThis idea solves real long-term issues, especially around storage growth and lost coins, without violating Bitcoin’s hard cap of 21M. It’s less extreme than a reset or a fork—just an evolution of the rules over time.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

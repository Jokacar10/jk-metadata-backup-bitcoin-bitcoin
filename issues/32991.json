    "body": "In #28122, I start by updating the libsecp subtree with `git subtree pull --prefix src/secp256k1 <myfork> <mybranch> --squash`. When rebasing on this commit, I often need to use something like:\n\n```\ngit rebase --rebase-merges --strategy subtree -X theirs\n```\n\n.. which Just Works. However, now the CI fails when running:\n\n```\ngit rebase --exec 'git merge --no-commit ...'\n```\n\n.. as seen in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/16315746903/job/46081155541?pr=28122.\n\nOpening this issue to see if anyone has any ideas on this can be improved. I took a look at the job and didn't seen an obvious fix, but mostly because the logic for determining the list of commits seems very specific and I wasn't sure why its done that way.",

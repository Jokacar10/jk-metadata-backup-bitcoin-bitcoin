    "title": "Double Poisson Sum: Enhancing Energy Distribution in Bitcoin Proof of Work with Main Formula γ^(i/R) + ∑(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j)",
    "body": "Title: Double Poisson Sum: Enhancing Energy Distribution in Bitcoin Proof of Work with Main Formula γ^(i/R) + ∑(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j)\nAuthor: Farrel Al Feshal\nCreated: April 25, 2025\n\nAbstract\nIntroduces a novel mathematical framework, Double Poisson Sum, as a potential enhancement to Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The proposed main formula, γ^(i/R) + ∑(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j), aims to achieve a more equitable distribution of computational energy across the network while providing robust cryptographic resilience against quantum attacks, even with computational power scaling to 100 million qubits. Drawing inspiration from the Syamailcoin project—a cryptocurrency initiative by the author—this proposal outlines a mechanism to address issues like Falsehood Positivism and Disposable Commits Value, ensuring fairness and immutability without requiring frequent upgrades.\n\nMotivation\nBackground on Poisson Sum in Bitcoin\nBitcoin’s PoW relies on the Poisson process to model the probabilistic nature of block discovery by miners. The Poisson Sum has historically served as a cornerstone for Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment and block time consistency. However, as quantum computing advances, the cryptographic underpinnings of Bitcoin—such as SHA-256 and ECDSA—face potential vulnerabilities. Moreover, the current PoW system may lead to energy distribution inefficiencies, where miners with disproportionate computational power dominate rewards, potentially exacerbating centralization.\n\nProposal for Double Poisson Sum\nThe author proposes replacing the traditional Poisson Sum with a Double Poisson Sum, utilizing the formula γ^(i/R) + ∑(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j). This formula introduces a weighted summation mechanism to ensure that newly generated energy (computational effort) is distributed fairly among miners, mitigating the risk of centralization. The formula is designed to be quantum-resistant, leveraging a concept of \"pre-composition of positive energy\" to thwart quantum attacks, even with 100 million qubits.\n\nPersonal Context and Inspiration\nThe formula γ^(i/R) + ∑(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j) emerged from the author’s mathematical exploration in 2016, described as a \"Muscle Memory in Math\" experience. The author, Farrel Al Feshal, perceives mathematics as a journey (\"travelling in mathematics\"), where numbers transcend mere computation to embody dynamic energy flows. This perspective inspired the creation of Syamailcoin, a cryptocurrency project launched in September 2024 and relaunched on April 13, 2025, after addressing initial adoption challenges.\n\nSyamailcoin: A Case Study\n\nSyamailcoin was initially deployed using a Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) consensus mechanism but faced market entry barriers due to insufficient community support. After a reset, the project was relaunched with a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Fraction (PoF), where participants (termed fracters) perform fracting by matching fractions from 0.0002231668236 to 1 over 50 iterations. The total supply of Syamailcoin is highly limited, with only 1,648 coins remaining for fracting, making it significantly scarcer than Bitcoin’s 21 million coin cap. Syamailcoin aims to address Falsehood Positivism (the overemphasis on dominance through computational power or initial ownership) and Disposable Commits Value (the loss of computational effort in unfair systems).\n\nSpecification\n\nMain Formula: γ^(i/R) + ∑(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j)\n\nThe proposed formula consists of two components:\nγ^(i/R): Represents the exponential growth of energy, where:\nγ\\gamma\\gamma\n: Base energy coefficient (to be determined through empirical analysis).\n( i ): Iteration index, reflecting the current cycle of energy distribution.\n( R ): A scaling factor to control the rate of exponential growth.\n∑(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j): A weighted summation over previous states, where:\n( S[0:i] ): The cumulative state of energy from iteration 0 to ( i ).\nτ\\tau\\tau\n: A time-dependent weighting factor to ensure fairness across time.\nϕ\\phi\\phi\n: A phase coefficient to introduce variability.\n( j ): An index for phase iterations, ensuring dynamic energy allocation.\nDouble Poisson Sum Mechanism\nThe Double Poisson Sum enhances the traditional Poisson process by introducing a dual summation approach:\nFirst Sum: Captures the probabilistic distribution of block discovery, similar to the existing Poisson Sum.\nSecond Sum: Applies the weighted summation from the main formula to redistribute energy (computational effort) fairly among miners.\nThis mechanism ensures that each exposed Double Poisson Sum undergoes a weighted summation, resulting in a continuous and equitable distribution of newly generated energy based on PoW contributions.\nIntegration with Proof of Work\nThe formula can be integrated into Bitcoin’s PoW as follows:\nMiners compute the Double Poisson Sum as part of the difficulty adjustment algorithm.\nThe weighted summation ensures that miners with varying computational power receive proportional rewards, reducing the risk of centralization.\nThe formula’s design, rooted in syllogistic logic, ensures immutability and resistance to quantum attacks by requiring \"pre-composition of positive energy,\" a concept where attackers must align with the network’s energy flow to succeed—an infeasible task.\nAttack Vectors (Syamailcoin Context)\nSyamailcoin’s security model provides insights into potential attack vectors:\n51% Attack: In Syamailcoin, a 51% attack is infeasible because attackers must align with the positive energy flow, which confounds qubits. The same principle applies to Bitcoin with the Double Poisson Sum.\nImplementation Risks: The security of SAI-15 (Syamailcoin’s cryptographic framework) and Heterodyne depends on proper implementation. Bitcoin developers must ensure similar rigor if adopting these concepts.\nImplementation\nSyamailcoin Mechanisms\nFor context, Syamailcoin’s key mechanisms are outlined below:\nProof of Fraction (PoF): Fracters match fractions from 0.0002231668236 to 1 over 50 iterations, with rewards decreasing proportionally.\nSAI-15: A custom cryptographic framework, open for community upgrades but exclusive to Syamailcoin.\nHydra: A blockchain alternative for transaction recording, currently under development.\nNebula: A mathematical representation of new energy generation in the network.\nCall to Action\nThe author requests support from active Bitcoin programmers to:\nReview and adopt the Double Poisson Sum and main formula for Bitcoin.\nAssist in realizing Syamailcoin’s market entry, ensuring it complements Bitcoin as a store of value (\"traceable digital gold\").\nIf this proposal is rejected, the author will refrain from selling Bitcoin held in a cold wallet, emphasizing the need for community collaboration.\nBranding and Community Input (Syamailcoin Context)\nSyamail Meaning: \"Syamail\" translates to \"morals, character, or disposition\" in Arabic, reflecting the project’s ethical foundation. The author has no malicious intent behind the naming.\nLogo and Pricing: The author seeks community input on whether Syamailcoin’s logo should feature Arabic script and on determining the initial sale price.\nChallenges and Community Trust\nThe author acknowledges the skepticism toward cryptocurrency projects by young Indonesian developers due to past scams. Syamailcoin’s reset in 2025 addressed previous errors in applied mathematics and overambition. The author urges the community to look beyond the perception that a \"mathematically dense whitepaper equals genius,\" focusing instead on the project’s substance.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Syamailcoin project, for inspiring the Double Poisson Sum and main formula.\nThe Bitcoin community, for maintaining a decentralized ecosystem that allows for innovative proposals like this.\nAdditional Notes on Syamailcoin (Informational Context)\nVision and Goals\nSyamailcoin addresses Falsehood Positivism by ensuring no single entity (e.g., a Genesis Own) dominates the network, and Disposable Commits Value by valuing every fracter’s computational effort. The author, as an investor, seeks to foster a decentralized ecosystem.\nMarket Entry Challenges\nSyamailcoin’s initial launch in September 2024 failed due to insufficient community support. The relaunched version on April 13, 2025, with PoF, aims to overcome this by focusing on fairness and scarcity (1,648 coins remaining).\nSecurity Model\nSyamailcoin’s security is robust:\nHeterodyne: Obscures data from qubits, making quantum attacks infeasible.\nPositive Energy Requirement: Ensures attackers cannot manipulate the network without aligning with its energy flow, a practically impossible task.\nCommunity Involvement\nThe author invites the Bitcoin community to contribute to Syamailcoin’s development, particularly in finalizing the Hydra transaction recording system, which remains a work in progress.\nConclusion Double Poisson Sum and the formula γ^(i/R) + ∑(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j) to enhance Bitcoin’s PoW, drawing inspiration from Syamailcoin. The mechanism ensures equitable energy distribution, quantum resistance, and long-term stability without frequent \n![IMG_20250413_131538](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/578b3dcd-c1f9-4e0a-a7a0-f539cbb178d4)\n![IMG_20250413_131513](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/755a2a90-d2f5-4e11-b9f7-5fee47ae396d).

      "body": "@willcl-ark Thanks a lot, I did Muscle Memory in Math in 2016 for Syamailcoin, and I never know if it is not possible to market under 21 Million, CoinMarketCap say I must have Big Community to Enter the Crypto Market, in September 2024 I managed to run consensus but because I didn't think about the community from the beginning, i reset all and on 13 April 2025 i did the last revision in the whitepaper.\n\nMaybe I'm a little tired, not a day goes by without thinking about this and whether the laws of nature reject Supply are much rarer than Bitcoin 21M? I feel this my mistake and no learn from past.\n\nTo be honest i prefer Bitcoin to Hold in Cold Wallet, but if you are experienced in the world of mathematics or economics or Cryptography can you give me help or direct me? I had a chance to send a BIP Draft to Bitcoindev@googlegroups.com Email and I haven't been allowed to send to a GitHub BIP, if it is not pleasing or suitable for Bitcoin, I hope someone helps me realize Syamailcoin, I have a hard time getting attention but may I elaborate on Syamailcoin here? Isn't Syamailcoin aimed at resolving the problematic Falsehood Positivism and Disposable Commits Value? Because I, Farrel Al Feshal, have solved the main problem, which is Falsehood Positivism, both from the mathematical perspective and excessive desires from anyone who becomes a Genesis Owner. I no longer need to be a Genesis Owner.\n\nSyamailcoin was successfully running in September 2024 with Consensus Proof of Elapsed Time, but errors occurred in the Big Community that I don't own to fully meet the Market Entry requirements at that time. As a result, I reset everything, and on April 13, 2025, the perfect Syamailcoin was born.\n\nWith Proof of Fraction, Fracters will perform fracting by matching Syamailcoin fractions from the smallest, namely 0.0002231668236 up to 1, as many as 50x, and Syamailcoin Rewards will be distributed or reduced according to the proportional time in the Syamailcoin Whitepaper; leaving 1,648 Syamailcoin that can still be fracting because of the said 0.0002231668236.\n\nI know that trust in creations by Indonesian Young People has been shattered because previously there were fraudulent Coins and Tokens, and after I reset them, Applied Mathematical Errors and Excessive Desires are two recurring mistakes that may cause ordinary people to view a Whitepaper full of Mathematics = Genius and Anything what you call.\n\nThe meaning of Nebula is not actually a Primordial Nebula but a Mathematical Representation to give birth to new energy in the Syamailcoin network, and the following are all the working methods and requirements of Syamailcoin, both inside and outside.\n\nSyamail can mean Morals, Character, or Behavior, but I never had bad intentions regarding the meaning or naming.\n\nI only need to be an Investor; does the logo need to be like Arabic writing for Syamail? All of that goes back to Community agreement, as does the initial selling price. Syamailcoin resolves 7 main pillars and criticizes entities that validate from Physics and our fears about how we account for things in the World in Life after death.\n\nHow to hack Syamailcoin? They must face the Heterodyne earlier and pre-compose positive energy, not negative energy, meaning it's never possible because Qubits will continue to be confused about reading and breaking Syamailcoin, including 51% regardless of how many Qubits are present, whether 10,000,000 or 100,000,000 Qubits. Why? Because the only way for an Attacker to infiltrate the Syamailcoin network is through pre-composition of positive energy, not negative energy. If not, then from the beginning, they will never be able to control this 51%. This is a game of Syllogistic Logic and Cryptography that only needs to be resolved by You and doesn't need to be upgraded every year.\n\nFracting: The activity of matching Syamailcoin fraction calculations from the smallest, namely 0.0002231668236 up to 1, as many as 50x.\nFracter: Term for Participants who perform fracting.\nSAI-15: Independent Cryptography that I prepare for You to upgrade together until completion, and Syamailcoin is not allowed to implement any Cryptography other than SAI-15, meaning Validation Checksum based on SAI-15.\nγ^(i/R) + Σ(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j): This is the Main Formula of Syamailcoin. When energy continues to be born, it creates exposed energy, alias exponential, there will be a weighted sum which will then be grouped in this Proof of Fraction, aiming for Syamailcoin's energy to be allocated fairly and with a Rational Barrier to Entry while providing protection without needing to be changed indefinitely.",

      "body": "@willcl-ark \n\nI am Farrel Al Feshal who is currently active as a Cryptographer, and I want to realize this Syamailcoin, a Layer-1 that I know has never existed in our country, despite the trust because of artistic tokens and exchange tokens not being obstacles for me. This is not just referential reading, but I did Muscle Memory in Math in 2016 where I felt Mathematics is not just numbers but I can travel within Mathematics itself.\n\nIn short, I have successfully launched it but according to CMC, it needs a Big Community to enter the Market; otherwise, reset all.\n\nSyamailcoin is derived from my favorite book, Syamail Al-Muhammadiyah, where the meaning of the name in Indonesian sounds good. Character, Adab, Behavior without negative connotations and peace tolerance for all. Syamailcoin solves 7 main pillars and all types of Quantum including Quantum Teleport, Quantum Computing, Quantum with Decision Tree Classifier, Quantum Flux resolved in the Main Formula γ*(i/R) + Σ(S[O:i]·τ·φ*j) & SAI-15 Checksum & Hydra.\"\n\n\"The Main Formula in Syamailcoin is like Multidimensional which is separate from the Quantum Teleport threat. Why? Energy exposed at the Syamailcoin Node will be counted before Syamailcoin Fractions are diversified through Threshold Criteria 14, 47% and 51% in Proof of Fraction, meaning Teleport does not steal from inactive old Wallets.\n\nQuantum Computing? Qubits clearly must face Heterodyne earlier and Pre-composition of positive energy, not negative energy, meaning Attackers are always confused trying to break Syamailcoin's SAI-15. \"Oh too many Qubits\" There is Pre-composition to compose positive not negative from Energy state or Super Compute, that's the concrete law in Electro when there is Byzantine also being cautious and returns to γ*(i/R) + Σ(S[O:i]·τ·φ*j)\n\nQuantum DTC? Just complete the Checksum in the ongoing transaction process. Quantum Flux? Each Threshold and Proportional Time Supply decreases will create new energy with subjectivity on Hydra, because consequences arise due to Syamailcoin energy fluctuations which, like many other Crypto cases, get suspended and modified without having to go through protocol.\"\n\n\"I no longer need to be Genesis and Inside Outside always trying to resolve in Syamailcoin, I don't know for sure how Indonesia will respond to hearing something new like this in Indonesia but I'm quite confident Mathematics is the agreed way for our negotiations in the war of thoughts, digital asset war, have a nice day.\n\nIf you want to publish the Whitepaper, please do so, because the DNS from my Device doesn't fully support it yet. Thank you.\n\nRegards,\nFarrel Al Feshal",

    "title": "Set default datacarriersize to 160 bytes",
    "body": "**Many current Bitcoin Core users do not support setting the default datacarriersize to 100,000 bytes in the upcoming v30 release**\nThis conclusion is based on following weeks of public threads.\nThe community is divided, and this proposal to set datacarriersize to 160 bytes aims to unify users with a balanced compromise.\n\n**Why 160 bytes**\nUsers often view OP_RETURN outputs larger than 160 bytes as excessive for typical use cases, \npreferring smaller limits to prioritize financial transactions.\n\n**Why is large OP_RETURN usage different from Taproot abuse**\nTaproot spam is an obvious abuse of the protocol whereas using one large OP_RETURN is perceived as an endorsed way to spam.\nBoth are bad, but the latter is regulatory worse.\n\n**Mempool alignment**\nWith a 100,000-byte default, users may choose different datacarriersize values, causing inconsistent mempools. \nA 160-byte default is more likely to be widely adopted, aligning mempools across nodes and improving network consistency.\n\n**Call for feedback**\nI invite Bitcoin Core users to share support (üëç) or opposition (üëé) to this proposal to simplify the review process.",

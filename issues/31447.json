You fixed it in #31250, in 9beab081e977e86a462854035ad31a118a8b13ae. It works fine because the legacy wallet can no longer be loaded there, but a direct cherry-pick into master would prematurely block the reload while it's possible when bdb is still enabled. I initially started coding the fix the same way you did but decided to keep the reload enabled until we fully disable bdb in #31250. Yet, I'm not totally convinced about the approach atm, happy to receive some feedback.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Px (Fork focused on Persons, remove institutions)",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nIn this new fork, only one wallet could be created for each physical persona, probably using a proof like the national identity number \"[NIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number)\" (e.g.: US+SSN, MX+CURP, etc.), and getting sure it's a living person (not yet registered as death). \n\nTo be able to carry out transactions with institutions, this could be done, through decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n\nTo perform the fork migration, after the snapshot of the blockchain, the replication of the original bitcoins should be requested from the original Bitcoin wallet addressing the personal wallet in the new fork (Bitcoin Px).\nInstitutional Bitcoins could be replicated in to a personal wallet, but this replication should have a maximum congruent limit (maybe 10 or 20 times the average wealth of a global citizen).\n\nBitcoins that aren't reclaimed under the replication period (maybe 3 months), should be nonexistent in the new blockchain, so they are available to be mined as fresh new Bitcoins.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nThe problem this issue would deal with, is the current centralization of the available money under the control of a few institutions, giving them power over society. Leaving once again the power of the whole/conjunct (democracy) at the mercy of the power of a few (oligarchy).\n\nNow that the efficiency of Bitcoin has been accepted even by institutions, maybe it's time to stop pandering those institutional whales, by creating an institution-proof Bitcoin replica, exclusively for physical persons. This could be a way to decentralize money in a second phase.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAs long as only humans are able to step inside this money platform, and institutions can be kept away, even   through false human agents, this could work also as a worldwide equity platform.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nIf the proof method chosen is NIN's, for the citizens of countries without any trustful NIN system, a solution could be created in collaboration with other Bitcoin cycle agents (miners, nodes, etc).\n\nBiometrics, genome or blood could be an alternative to NIN's, but would add a huge layer of complexity.\n\nI would disagree with any solution that involves invasive technology.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nI completely understand this would drastically remove the \"anonymity\" from Bitcoin, but it could be also a good thing for addressing iniquity and corruption (at least inside this blockchain).",

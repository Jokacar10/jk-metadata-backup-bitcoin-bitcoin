It's possible to reproduce the issue locally by just running mptest in a loop thousands of times until it locks up.\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/189 happens because the new \"disconnecting and blocking\" test introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/160 tests for for problems with unclean disconnections that weren't previously detected. The most common issues with unclean disconnections were fixed in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/160. But two more issues with unclean disconnections that happened reliably in CI were fixed https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/186, and one more unclean disconnect issue that happens more rarely and isn't fixed yet is described in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/189. The issue is debugged and I think should not be hard to fix but I wanted to hold off because the previous fixes had a bunch of manual testing and seemed to work well in practice while this issue was more artificial, happening as a result of the way the test was written.",

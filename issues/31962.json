    "title": "compact blocks in IBD resets m_stalling_since",
    "body": "During IBD it is possible that a malicious peer sends unsolicited compact-block messages to reset its `m_stalling_since` state. This requires two or more malicious peer connections and can happen with the following steps:\n- Malicious peer A sends a headers message that contains height `h+1`. The node requests block `h+1` from peer A.\n- Malicious peer B sends a headers message that contains heights `{h+1, h+2, ..., h+1024}`. The node requests `MAX_BLOCKS_IN_TRANSIT_PER_PEER` blocks from B. Peer B does not need to reply with any of these blocks.\n- Honest peer C sends a headers message that contains heights `{h+1, h+2, ..., h+1024}`. The node will request blocks continuing from where it last requested from peer B.\n- Peer A sends a compact-block for `h+2` with non-empty but bogus `shorttxids`.\n  - The target node will attempt to process the compact-block since it is within two blocks of `h`. The `CanDirectFetch` logic is also skipped [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3c1f72a36700271c7c1293383549c3be29f28edb/src/net_processing.cpp#L4386-L4389) as the block is already in-flight with peer B.\n  - Since the `shorttxids` field is bogus, execution hits [this branch](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3c1f72a36700271c7c1293383549c3be29f28edb/src/net_processing.cpp#L4449-L4450) and calls `RemoveBlockRequest`. This will reset `m_stalling_since` even though peer A hasn't actually provided a block.\n  - This can be repeated by peer A to reset `m_stalling_since` before [the timeout triggers](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3c1f72a36700271c7c1293383549c3be29f28edb/src/net_processing.cpp#L5789-L5801). The peer should eventually be disconnected (unless it gives the block) after the larger block download timeout of ~10minutes+ depending on the number of downloading peers which could be numerous in IBD.\n\nI think this scenario is a bit contrived since it requires two (or more?) malicious peers whom are requested subsequent blocks, but it illustrates that:\n- resetting `m_stalling_since` in this case is a bug\n- compact-blocks can be received unsolicited even in IBD.  The block must be currently in-flight and must be one of the two blocks above the target node's tip.\n\nHere is a branch that demonstrates this with a functional test: https://github.com/Crypt-iQ/bitcoin/tree/ibd_cmpct",

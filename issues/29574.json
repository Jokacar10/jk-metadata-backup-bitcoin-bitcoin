So perhaps this is a (historical and) purposeful decision. It appears this has been the case since [2014](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a60120e951ae94d0553c5515229432e016fb0657) when this file was introduced. I roughly checked a few version previous and only found references to mainnet seeds. This would seem like an odd decision to me though, so perhaps I'm missing something here.\r\n\r\nFor mainnet we have _nodes_main.txt_ which includes auto-fetched addresses from a dns seeder, and _nodes_main_manual.txt_ which adds onion and I2P seeds.\r\nBy contrast for testnet _nodes_test.txt_ is not in fact ipv4 addresses, but manually-added tor v3 addresses.\r\n\r\nIf we want testnet nodes to be able to sync without relying on dns seeds then we should consider adding some testnet IPV4 addresses.",

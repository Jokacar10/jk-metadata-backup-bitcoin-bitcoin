      "body": "The wallet seed is stored as (coerced into) a `CKey` which is constrained to 32 bytes. With descriptor wallets it's probably more doable to add a new seed storage mechanism.\r\n\r\nI do think there's a use case for migrating funds from a mnemonic backup to a Bitcoin Core wallet (with or without a sweep). BIP39 mnemonics are abundant and there's probably plenty of people who no longer have - or trust - the original wallet that generated it. Right now the only practical way to do that is to import the mnemonic in an arbitrary other (hardware) wallet and then send the coins.\r\n\r\nBut it's a non trivial change.  Perhaps it's better left to when we have an additional use case for a different seed storage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat still leaves the possibility of a watch-only import. Arguably this is dangerous and users should instead import an account level xpub if they need a watch-only wallet.\r\n\r\nAs far hashing, we do have `HMAC-SHA-512`: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/crypto/hmac_sha512.h\r\n\r\nAssuming this earlier attempt by @mateusz is correct, implementing PBKDF2 pretty short: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20361/commits/7e6ba0a3278ff0938c617a234ff07be8a20b06ed#diff-72f3c3f065865085863d0a6577e18effa07a22f3fc2df6e77b5f7089159bc031",

      "body": "Briefly looked at this again. Importing with private key functionality seems doable (not just watch-only).\r\n\r\n1. We need to store the extended private key of the root node (easier after #26728): internally our wallet does this by storing the full extended public key and a regular `CKey` for the private key.\r\n2. We don't have to store the mnemonic. But if we wanted to, we have to make sure it gets encrypted along with other private key material.\r\n3. Both seed and passphrase would (initially) be constrained to English, more precisely, these characters (see descriptors.cpp):\r\n\r\n```\r\n0123456789()[],'/*abcdefgh@:$%{}\r\nIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&+-.;<=>?!^_|~\r\nijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGH`#\"\\\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat restriction just needs clear documentation \"You can't import […]\".\r\n\r\n5. The mnemonic (not the password) should be restricted to valid BIP39 (lower case, matching checksum)\r\n6. Add a warning if the length is unusual (not 12 or 24 words)\r\n7. The regular descriptor wallet creation process already uses BIP44/etc derivations. Users can add custom derivations if needed (perhaps by expanding `createwalletdescriptor` after #25907). \r\n8. PBKDF2 can use existing HMAC-SHA-512 (see comment above)\r\n9. It needs a BIP (in the BIP-380 series)\r\n10. Restoring a wallet should be very quick on an unpruned node with `-blockfilterindex=1` and even quicker after #26951",

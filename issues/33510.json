    "title": "Mempool Expiry eviction might remove txs that could be mined in the next block",
    "body": "`LimitMempoolSize` always try to remove transactions from the mempool whose age has passed the mempool expiry time limit, which is 336 hours (i.e., two weeks) by default.\n\nThere might be a case where you evict something that might be mined next. For example, the mempool was cleared and some low feerate transaction that has been in the mempool and has not confirmed in a long time due to having a low feerate is now at the top of the mempool.\nHowever, when we want to limit the mempool size, we will evict such transactions.\n\nWe can limit the harm of this by only expiring when the mempool is full now then post Cluster mempool, in addition to the transaction entry time, it would be possible to keep track of how many times you expect the transaction to confirm and it has not. If it has reached some threshold and the expiry time of the tx has been reached, then drop the transaction from the mempool because you know the transaction is likely deliberately ignored by miners (On the assumption that the node policy rules is sane and miners use tx fee as incentive for selection of transaction into their block template) hence no need to save it in the nodes mempool.\n",

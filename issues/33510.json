    "body": "`LimitMempoolSize` always try to remove transactions from the mempool whose age has passed the mempool expiry time limit, which is 336 hours (i.e., two weeks) by default.\n\nThere might be a case where you evict something that might be mined next. For example, the mempool was cleared and some low feerate transaction that has been in the mempool and has not confirmed in a long time due to having a low feerate is now at the top of the mempool.\nHowever, when we want to limit the mempool size, we will evict such transactions.\n\nWe can limit the harm of this by only expiring when the mempool is full now then post Cluster mempool, in addition to the transaction entry time, it would be possible to keep track of how many times you expect the transaction to confirm and it has not. If it has reached some threshold and the expiry time of the tx has been reached, then drop the transaction from the mempool because you know the transaction is likely deliberately ignored by miners (On the assumption that the node policy rules is sane and miners use tx fee as incentive for selection of transaction into their block template) hence no need to save it in the nodes mempool.\n",

I've thought about using fees actually in the mempool, or time-based experation.\n\nThere are also two relevant irc discussions: [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20151016174215/http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2015/09/28#l1443480600.0) and [here](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2015-10-02#1443822540-1443822720;)\n\n<details><summary>Mempool Expiry PR History Diagram</summary>\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[#6331] --> D(#6421)\n    B[#6410] --> D\n    C[#6281] --> D\n    D --> |time expiry added| G[#6455]\n    E[#6452] --> G\n    F[#6453] --> G\n    G --> H[#6470]\n    H --> I[#6557]\n    I --> J[#6722]\n    J --> |merged| K[master]\n    \n    click A \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6331\" _blank\n    click B \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6410\" _blank\n    click C \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6281\" _blank\n    click D \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6421\" _blank\n    click E \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6452\" _blank\n    click F \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6453\" _blank\n    click G \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6455\" _blank\n    click H \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6470\" _blank\n    click I \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6557\" _blank\n    click J \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6722\" _blank\n    click K \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/49b6fd5663dfe081d127cd1eb11407c4d3eaf93d\" _blank\n```\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n----\nFrom this and my own assumptions, I gather that the time-based expiry is generally intended to evict transactions that a node believes are likely to be mined but empirical evidence has shown miners are not including for a long enough period of time that we think those transactions will never be included, maybe because miners:\n\n- Are censoring these transactions\n- Have a different estimation of their feerate\n- Have a soft-fork activated that your node doesn't that makes the high feerate transactions consensus invalid\n\n> How about we make the expiration time dynamic based on the position (computer by fee rate) in the mempool?\n>\n> Txs more likely to be mined have a bigger expiry time\n\nI think this should be the opposite, the transactions that are the best candidates for time-based expiry, are the ones that are at the top of our mempool, but block after block remain unconfirmed.\n\n> We could just get rid of expiration entirely if a time-based limit wasn't valuable, and just rely on eviction due to fullness.\n\nMy gut reaction is that time-based expiry isn't helpful, but without it, it seems like it would be easy to break the mempools of nodes that are missing a soft fork, since you could broadcast a mempool's worth of post-soft-fork-invalid high-fee transactions for \"free\" to pre-soft-fork nodes, and they will never let go of them, but I suppose the current behavior where an attacker has to periodically rebroadcast is not that big of a barrier.\n",

Without the expiry time, you can dos a mempool with 1 single attack.",

    "title": "Stratum v2 via IPC Mining Interface tracking issue",
    "body": "After much discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432 it appears there's currently little support for directly supporting Stratum v2 in Bitcoin Core, with most contributors favouring the creation of a Mining IPC interface that external applications can use.\n\nThe only such application currently is the Template Provider implemented by me in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48. This also serves to illustrate how the interface is used and that it's complete. The folks working on SRI should be able to build a Template Provider as well, once the interface is complete and shipped in a release.\n\n### Needed for (hopefully) v29 / v30\n\nTo complete the interface:\n\n- [x] #31318\n- [ ] #31283 (replaces #31003) \n  - [x] #31325\n  - [x] #31581\n  - [ ] #31785\n- [x] #31346\n- [x] #31196\n- [x] #31197\n- [x] #31288\n- [x] https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/122 (not used by Stratum v2)\n\nFor multiprocess release binaries\n\n- [x] #31763 (pending \"officially\" shipping `bitcoin-node`)\n- [ ] #31375\n  - To resolve #30983\n- [ ] #31741\n- [ ] #30975 \n- [x] https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/pull/119\n- [x] https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/117\n- [x] #31455\n- [x] #31151\n- [ ] https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/123\n- [x] https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/128\n\nLibmultiprocess bugfixes\n\n- [x] https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/pull/120\n- [x] https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/pull/121\n- [x] https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/pull/127\n\n### Can wait for later releases\n\n- [x] #31827 \n- [ ] Windows support\n  - [ ] https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/114\n  - [ ] add `bitcoin-node.exe` etc to Windows build\n  - [ ] add `bitcoin.exe` to Windows build (e.g. 26d3a069f94e2cabcc8d1f73fd2cfa3e7c320497)\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30437\n- [x] #31002 DATUM developers are currently uninterested in taking advantage of the more performant interface, preferring to use the `getblocktemplate` RPC instead, despite an earlier concept ACK on Stratum v2 support https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27854#issuecomment-1605237375.\n- new interface methods:\n  - `createFutureBlock()` for faster work switching, see #31109\n  - `waitNewPowBlock()` for SPV mining, see #31109\n  - `verifyBlock(CBlock block, bool allow_rollback, bool check_pow, uint256 target)`\n     * for Stratum v2 pools to verify a proposed block, ignoring PoW\n     * can also be used to verify weak blocks in P2pool like systems\n     * can use the mempool to accelerate validation, but doesn't update it\n     * (maybe) can optionally roll back, to inspect older templates\n\n### Current Template Provider users \n\nAs a stop-gap measure I plan to maintain https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/68 which is a continuation of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432, since people are currently using that. Once the Mining interface makes it into a release, along with multiprocess enabled Guix binaries, I plan to drop that in favour of https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48.\n\nAdditionally I plan to convert the latter from a patch set on top of Bitcoin Core into a standalone application, to make it easier for others to contribute. That should make it less dependent on my own effort. The Bitcoin Core project could decide in the future to \"adopt\" this project, but that is entirely uncertain and most contributors seems averse to this idea.",

      "body": "> The mining interface in interfaces/mining.h, node/interfaces.cpp and mining.capnp is orders of magnitude less code than what's currently in https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/68. That would be still be true after a refactor of Sv2Connman.\r\n\r\nI'm curious where the bulk of that is. It should be basically identical in terms of total volume (framing and such all has to happen either way, even if its auto-generated code when using capnproto), the protocol would be ~identical in function, and IPC vs TCP should be fairly similar (I assume its a socket interface either way). That just leaves the encryption on top which IIRC wasn't a huge volume of code.\r\n\r\n>  It also moves all DoS-resistance responsibility to the user of this trusted interface.\r\n\r\nI'm curious what the worry is here - the protocol is almost entirely push-only, do we anticipate DoS is a material risk there? If there are material concerns here (eg too-large-coinbase-tx signaling pushing transactions out of the template attacks) they'll simply not be addressed at all. The nice thing about having things in an active project is that people may actually look at it.\r\n\r\n> There are several concept NACKs on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432 and earlier versions of it. There were a few concept ACKs from experienced developers on the first version in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432, but they haven't reviewed this work. The pace of review on the sub PRs for noise encryption https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29346 / https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/66, transport https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30315 / https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/67, connection management https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/67 and the template provider application https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/49 is glacial, it would take years at this pace to get them merged.\r\n\r\nI understand things may be slow, but I'm curious why the conclusion there is that instead we should build a new protocol that accomplishes substantially the same thing but with fewer features. If the concern is that things like the encryption layer are moving too slow and we want to get something out it would be perfectly reasonable to ship a shorter-term patchset that doesn't support that and consider adding support for it later. Same goes for TCP, even, we could consider adding a named-socket-only version that does the same framing but based on named sockets to get something available and slowly add the full protocol parts at a later time based on use.\r\n\r\n> In contrast review on the multiprocess approach has been fast.\r\n\r\nYes, developers have a tendency to prefer their own NIH thing, but that is fairly weak justification.\r\n\r\n> Nothing changes here. Anyone can run bitcoin-node and connect a template provider application to it that listens on the public internet, either the one I wrote or a new one.\r\n\r\nThat is a very substantial change - requiring an external application makes the value proposition of a common protocol that miners can connect to third-party nodes for templates much, much weaker. \"Just turn this option on in bitcoin.conf\" is a very different story from \"also figure out how to reliably operate some unmaintained software that someone posted on github five years ago\" (which is the current state of much of the solo-mining world).\r\n\r\n> The Mining interface was designed by refactoring https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/68 to use it. Additionally there's a few methods that the RPC uses internally. There's not much more to it.\r\n\r\nSure, and there's no much more to the Sv2 mining interface either :). Either way, I'm still kinda confused why it was decided to NIH a new protocol here.\r\n\r\n> I think you're assuming here that this IPC is directly exposed to the untrusted internet? It's really only supposed to be used by a trusted application that in turn can accept connections from the outside.\r\n\r\nNo, I am not. Exposing work coming out of Bitcoin Core is possibly the most important API from Bitcoin Core (outside of P2P and maybe `sendrawtransaction`) for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Defining a new API to do it haphazardly seems incredibly strange to me.",

It'd be nice to have it listen on TCP, but that's much better accomplished with `netcat` than some kind of protocol translation.\r\n\r\n> One obvious DoS issue is that as clients receive multiple templates the node holds on to transaction references even as the mempool drops them. I still have to open a followup issue to discuss that. One suggested solution is to have the node refuse to make new templates are some time, or give the client a way to measure memory footprint so it can choose which older templates to drop. That doesn't have to be fully resolved on the Bitcoin Core end: it sees bitcoin-stratum as a trusted process, it will have to deal with the problem.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with just having a fixed timeout? As Bitcoin Core is now the thing responsible for deciding when a new template is created it is in full control of the memory used and can keep track of how much memory it is using. It could even use the flush bit to clear out old work if the mempool fee is climbing rapidly.\r\n\r\n> More generally many historical bugs were in p2p code. Adding more p2p functionality adds more unknown unknowns.\r\n\r\nYea, but that's why this is an almost-push-only protocol, much fewer unknown unknowns :).\r\n\r\n> Hopefully I clarified above that this doesn't replace stratum v2, it's a layer in between. I'm able to reuse the same code for both the integrated and via-IPC Template Provider, so there's no loss in functionality. The only big difference is division of responsibility for maintaining the functionality.\r\n> I think Stratum v2 should remain the standard for that.\r\n\r\nI strongly disagree, there's a separate discussion on the Sv2 github (which I know you disagree with) on dropping the TP in favor of this new IPC TP, but I see zero reason why we should define a secondary Sv2-specific protocol for TP(ing) when there's a perfectly fine one in Core. I'm not really a fan of the ecosystem standardizing a protocol around capnproto and everyone being forced to take a dependency on it (or maybe its encoding is simple enough that others can implement it by hand? not sure) and hope that this new protocol eventually gets exposed over TCP with  cryptographic authentication, but even with those there's no reason to have some Sv2-specific nonsense. Please let's not have two nearly-identical protocols for the same thing, that's insane.",

      "body": "In both versions `-sv2interval` specifies the _minimum_ time before sending a fee update, and it currently can't / shouldn't be set lower than 1 second. This minimum is not related to polling between two processes.\r\n\r\nIt's there because determining the new fees requires the node to construct a whole new block template under the hood. This is currently inefficient so the node waits one second between each template generation. But once it finds a better template the node _pushses_ it to the `bitcoin-mine` process.\r\n\r\nThe minimum interval can hopefully be dropped after Cluster Mempool is done #30289, as that should make it much cheaper to figure out how much fees for the next block have increased. At that point you can just set `-sv2interval=0` so it won't require an interface change.\r\n\r\nThe default value is 30 seconds which is probably a bit overkill conservative. It's there to avoid spamming the pool. And because perhaps ASICs have some overhead when loading a new template. Happy to take recommendations for a different default.",

To me ephemeral dust enables exogenous fees, avoiding the need to commit to a fee-rate. Would say \"introduces ephemeral dust in order to defer committing to fees\".\n\n> Libnatpmp was replaced with a built-in implementation of PCP and NAT-PMP. \n\n\"custom\" or \"bespoke\" rather than \"built-in\"?\n\n> wil result that Bitcoin core wil fail to start.\n\nwill\n\n> getmininginfo\n\nMight be cool if one could provoke a case where `next` had different values from current. regtest has a `nMinerConfirmationWindow` of 144 blocks instead of the regular 2016, but I don't know how/if difficulty adjustments work there.\n\n> getblock, getblockheader, getblockchaininfo, getchainstates\n\nFeels a bit verbose how the guide currently goes through all the added target/bits fields, maybe one could just list the RPCs and what new fields to expect, then list one example output?",

To me ephemeral dust enables exogenous fees, avoiding the need to commit to a fee-rate. Would say \"introduces ephemeral dust in order to defer committing to fees\".\n\nChanged ✅\n> \n> > Libnatpmp was replaced with a built-in implementation of PCP and NAT-PMP.\n> \n> \"custom\" or \"bespoke\" rather than \"built-in\"?\n\nChanged ✅\n> \n> > wil result that Bitcoin core wil fail to start.\n> \n> will\n> \n\nChanged ✅\n> > getmininginfo\n> \n> Might be cool if one could provoke a case where `next` had different values from current. regtest has a `nMinerConfirmationWindow` of 144 blocks instead of the regular 2016, but I don't know how/if difficulty adjustments work there.\n\nOpen 🤔\n> \n> > getblock, getblockheader, getblockchaininfo, getchainstates\n> \n> Feels a bit verbose how the guide currently goes through all the added target/bits fields, maybe one could just list the RPCs and what new fields to expect, then list one example output?\n\nChanged ✅\n\nThanks for the feedback.

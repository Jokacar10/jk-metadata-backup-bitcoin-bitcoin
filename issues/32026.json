To me ephemeral dust enables exogenous fees, avoiding the need to commit to a fee-rate. Would say \"introduces ephemeral dust in order to defer committing to fees\".\n\n> Libnatpmp was replaced with a built-in implementation of PCP and NAT-PMP. \n\n\"custom\" or \"bespoke\" rather than \"built-in\"?\n\n> wil result that Bitcoin core wil fail to start.\n\nwill\n\n> getmininginfo\n\nMight be cool if one could provoke a case where `next` had different values from current. regtest has a `nMinerConfirmationWindow` of 144 blocks instead of the regular 2016, but I don't know how/if difficulty adjustments work there.\n\n> getblock, getblockheader, getblockchaininfo, getchainstates\n\nFeels a bit verbose how the guide currently goes through all the added target/bits fields, maybe one could just list the RPCs and what new fields to expect, then list one example output?",

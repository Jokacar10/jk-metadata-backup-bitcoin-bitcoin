To prevent this issue, it is proposed to convert even-numbered values to binary, improving transaction security and blockchain integrity.Currently, double spending can occur in certain digital currency transactions, potentially compromising security. The blockchain system and consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW) aim to prevent this issue, but further optimizations are needed. By converting even-numbered values into binary, transaction security can be improved, and internet stability reinforced\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nCurrently, double spending can occur in certain digital currency transactions, potentially compromising security.\n\nThe blockchain system and consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW) aim to prevent this issue, but further optimizations are needed.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nEnhancing transaction security by converting even-numbered values into binary, reducing the likelihood of double spending, and strengthening blockchain integrity. Optimizing this process to ensure internet stability and prevent fraudulent activities in crypto networks.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nwindows\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

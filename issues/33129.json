    "title": "Crash when chain tip is missing from candidate set",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\n`setBlockIndexCandidates` can become empty if the chain tip is not included in the set, which violates an internal invariant and leads to a crash during `FindMostWorkChain()`. This issue and potential solutions were originally surfaced by ataraxia009 in #33127.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nAfter pruning, the active tip must be present in the candidate set. No crash should occur in `FindMostWorkChain()`. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nMine a chain\nManually remove the tip from `setBlockIndexCandidates`\nCall `PruneBlockIndexCandidates()`\nObserve that `setBlockIndexCandidates` no longer contains the tip -> This violates an invariant relied upon by FindMostWorkChain()\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv29.99.0-75ed673\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nMac\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\n`setBlockIndexCandidates` can become empty if the chain tip is not included in the set, which violates an internal invariant and leads to a crash during `FindMostWorkChain()`. This issue and potential solutions were originally surfaced by ataraxia009 in #33127.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nAfter pruning, the active tip must be present in the candidate set. No crash should occur in `FindMostWorkChain()`. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nMine a chain\nManually remove the tip from `setBlockIndexCandidates`\nCall `PruneBlockIndexCandidates()`\nObserve that `setBlockIndexCandidates` no longer contains the tip -> This violates an invariant relied upon by FindMostWorkChain()\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv29.99.0-75ed673\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nMac\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "The issue I was addressing has nothing to do with `FindMostWorkChain` or a crash in it.\n\nThe root issue that I witnessed was a crash on launch in `PruneBlockIndexCandidates` which is caused by the data dir reaching a bad state.\n\nIn this state, the block validity of the block indexes in the `setBlockIndexCandidates` was correct, i.e.: `BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS`, \nbut the block validity for the blocks that were used to to build the `CoinsView` and therefore the `M_Chain` did not have their required block validity, i.e `BLOCK_VALID_SCRIPTS`, the blocks with neither `BLOCK_VALID_SCRIPTS` nor `BLOCK_VALID_TRANSACTIONS` were being used as the `m_chain.tip`. Which should not be the case.\n\nThis caused all the `setBlockIndexCandidates` to have lesser work than the `m_chain.Tip`. Leaving the `setBlockIndexCandidates` empty after the `PruneBlockIndexCandidates` call during launch.\n\nI cannot figure out how the data got to that state because it seems like this state should never happen.\n\n",

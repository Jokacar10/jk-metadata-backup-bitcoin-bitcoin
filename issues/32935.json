See 'git --help'.` error.\n\nYou need to change it to something like:\n```bash\n  python3 -c '\nimport os\n\nexclude = {\"HOME\", \"PATH\", \"USER\", \"GIT_EXEC_PATH\"}\n\nfor key, value in os.environ.items():\n    if \"\\n\" in value or key in exclude:\n        continue\n    print(f\"{key}={value}\")\n' | tee \"/tmp/env-$USER-$CONTAINER_NAME\"\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\ngit clone works fine\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun CI script on e.g. awslinux and try to clone something inside build scripts\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nawslinux\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

It is never going to be complete anyway.

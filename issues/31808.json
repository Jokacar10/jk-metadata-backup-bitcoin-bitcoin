I'm split between labeling this as a bug or feature request, but chose to file as a bug because the wallet has everything it needs to spend the input. Please reclassify this as a feature request if you do find it fits better with that label.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Create a new wallet\n- Import the descriptor and derive an address:\n```\nexport desc=\"wsh(and_v(v:older(2),pk(tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPe5EVQ3cw3S1GdWyKxTeVvgVujejwFgJYGPucrUyPhsR2Zd4ngq3QSfB4HehpXqSPtwdoV7b8JYunU2kPai1AWUUxvb5gkrf/84h/1h/0h/1/*)))#tcaf9v8u\"\nexport descriptors=\"[{\\\"desc\\\":\\\"$desc\\\",\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"now\\\"}]\"\nb importdescriptors $descriptors\nb deriveaddresses $desc \"[1,1]\"\n```\n- Send money to the generated address from another wallet\n- Generate 3 blocks\n-  Switch back to the wallet with the above descriptor and try to send funds out\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster@a43f08c4ae\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

    "title": "Stop shipping ARM32 builds for releases?",
    "body": "Clearly there is no hurry here. This is more of a brainstorming issue than a proposal.\n\nFor:\n\n- 64-bit ARM is the standard nowadays for the type of computing hardware our users tend to have (modern Raspberry Pi's and ARM servers). While 32-bit ARM is only still used in low-power embedded systems, an unlikely combination with a bitcoin node.\n\n- 32-bit ARM is the last 32-bit architecture that we ship releases for. After removing this, we could fully focus on optimizing for large virtual address spaces. This means nearly-unrestricted `mmap`, and no need to worry about the virtual memory overhead of more thread stacks.\n\n- Is it still being properly tested at all? If no one really cares, things could break without us noticing.\n\nAgainst:\n\n- There are likely still users that use 2010-era ARM boxes for their nodes, though the number is likely to be dwindling (mine certainly died by now).\n\n- *Requiring* 64-bit even for self-built binaries is a step further, it might be wise to keep the 32-bit door open, at least i'm always hesitant with anything that limits potential hardware that can be used for bitcoin nodes.\n\nSee also bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org#1126, where the default was recently changed to 64-bit.",

      "body": "IIRC, Raspberry Pi OS only started shipping 64-bit OSes a couple of years ago. For a while, you could buy a Pi 3 or 4 which had 64-bit hardware but the available Raspberry Pi OS image was only 32-bit. I would imagine that several of these machines are probably still in use. It also seems like the 32-bit images are still prominently shown on their [website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) so I think it may be a bit premature to stop shipping 32-bit?",

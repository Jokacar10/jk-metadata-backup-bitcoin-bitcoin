    "title": "Unusual \"Wallet requires newer version\" Error with wallet.dat on macOS, Even with Older Client",
    "body": "### Motivation\n\nI am encountering a persistent \"Wallet requires newer version of Bitcoin Core (code -4)\" error when trying to open my wallet.dat file on macOS. This issue occurs even when attempting to open the wallet with Bitcoin Core version 0.21.0.1, which the debug log from a later version (29.0) indicated was the last client version to interact with the wallet.\nEnvironment:\n * Operating System: macOS 15 \n * Bitcoin Core Version Initially Used: 29.0\n * Bitcoin Core Version Tested (Older): 0.21.0.1\nSteps to Reproduce:\n * Launch Bitcoin Core version 29.0.\n * Bitcoin Core attempts to load the wallet located at /Users/mac/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets/wallet.dat.\n * The error \"Wallet loading failed. Error loading /Users/mac/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets/wallet.dat: Wallet requires newer version of Bitcoin Core (code -4)\" is displayed.\n * As per troubleshooting suggestions, Bitcoin Core version 0.21.0.1 was downloaded and installed (after backing up the wallet1.dat file and uninstalling the newer version).\n * Launching Bitcoin Core version 0.21.0.1 resulted in the same \"Wallet requires newer version...\" error.\n * The -rescan command was attempted with version 29.0, and the blockchain synced successfully, but the error persists when trying to load wallet1.dat.\n * The -salvagewallet command was attempted with version 0.21.0.1, and it also resulted in the same \"Wallet requires newer version...\" error.\nRelevant Information from debug.log (from Bitcoin Core version 29.0):\n2025-05-18T05:53:16Z Using wallet /Users/mac/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/wallets/wallet1.dat\n2025-05-18T05:53:16Z init message: Loading walletâ€¦\n2025-05-18T05:53:16Z [wallet.dat] Wallet file version = 10500, last client version = 210201\n2025-05-18T05:53:16Z [wallet.dat] Releasing wallet wallet.dat..\n\nExpected Behavior:\nThe wallet should load successfully, especially with the Bitcoin Core version (0.21.0.1) that the log indicates last used it.\nActual Behavior:\nThe wallet fails to load with a \"newer version required\" error across multiple client versions, including the one that supposedly last used it.\nPossible Implications:\nThis behavior might indicate:\n * A bug in how Bitcoin Core handles certain types of wallet corruption or metadata.\n * An inaccurate reporting of the \"last client version\" in the debug log.\n * A fundamental incompatibility issue that isn't being correctly identified.\nRequest:\nCould the developers investigate this unusual behavior? The persistent \"newer version required\" error even with an older client version suggests a deeper issue that might affect other users in unexpected scenarios. Any insights or potential fixes would be greatly appreciated.\nAdditional Context:\n * The user (me) does not have any backups of the wallet.dat file or a recovery phrase.\n\n### Possible solution\n\nPossible update the qt framework to 6 and release a new version of Bitcoin core sooner than expected.\n\n### Useful Skills\n\n* Compiling Bitcoin Core from source\n* Running the C++ unit tests and the Python functional tests\n* ...\n\n\n### Guidance for new contributors\n\nWant to work on this issue?\n\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\n",

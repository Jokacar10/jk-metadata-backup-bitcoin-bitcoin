    "title": "Signed Integer Overflow in GetBlockSubsidy at block height 2,147,483,647 (During Epoch 10,227, halving 10,226) could increase the block subsidy, total supply, or potentially halt the network",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour\r\n\r\nThe GetBlockSubsidy function could potentially encounter a signed integer overflow if nHeight reaches the next value at 2,147,483,647 causing it to wrap to -2,147,483,648. This overflow can disrupt the halving mechanism implemented in the function, particularly around the calculated 10,226th halving interval derived from INT_MAX / nSubsidyHalvingInterval.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCAmount GetBlockSubsidy(int nHeight, const Consensus::Params& consensusParams)\r\n{\r\n    int halvings = nHeight / consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval;\r\n    // Force block reward to zero when right shift is undefined.\r\n    if (halvings >= 64)\r\n        return 0;\r\n\r\n    CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;\r\n    // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.\r\n    nSubsidy >>= halvings;\r\n    return nSubsidy;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implications\r\n\r\nSuch an overflow could lead to erroneous block subsidy calculations, impacting not only the subsidy value but also the overall supply curve of the cryptocurrency. This would diverge from the predefined monetary supply rules and could potentially compromise the economic model established by the protocol.\r\n\r\nEven if there are sanity checks in place to prevent these incorrect subsidy from being issued, the presence of such anomalous values could lead to a situation where no blocks are validated by the network. This would effectively halt the processing of new transactions and block creation, disrupting the network's functionality.\r\n\r\nThe failure to validate blocks because of incorrect block height values compromises the network's reliability and can lead to severe trust and security issues among users and participants. Therefore, it is crucial to address this to maintain the integrity and reliability of the monetary policy mechanism and the overall stability of the network.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to hard-code the block subsidy to be zero for block heights greater or equal than 64 times the consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval (64 * 210,000 which is 13,440,000). This approach aligns with the logical endpoint of the current halving mechanism, where the subsidy should theoretically reduce to zero due to the defined right shift operation, which becomes undefined beyond 64 halvings.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCAmount GetBlockSubsidy(unsigned long long nHeight, const Consensus::Params& consensusParams)\r\n{\r\n    if (nHeight >= 64 * consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval)\r\n        return 0;\r\n\r\n    unsigned long long halvings = nHeight / consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval;\r\n\r\n    CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;\r\n    // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.\r\n    nSubsidy >>= halvings;\r\n    return nSubsidy;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Further Analysys\r\n\r\nIt's conceivable that additional changes to the code might be necessary, especially in relation to handling the overflow of block height. Currently, with nHeight as an int type, Bitcoin is projected to reach its limit at the 10,226th halving, which corresponds to approximately the year 42,913 (10,226 * 4 + 2009).\r\n\r\nHowever, when utilizing larger primitive data types such as unsigned long long, an overflow is inevitable but delayed, thus significantly extending Bitcoin's operational timeline. With unsigned long long, the system wouldn't encounter a height overflow until the 18,446,744,073,709,551,615th halving. This scenario, calculated with the 4-year halving interval, plus the year of Bitcoin's inception in 2009, projects us to the year 73,786,976,294,838,208,469.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of such distant eventualities, it may be wise to introduce a new variable, such as \"life\" or \"generation\", of type unsigned long long. This addition would reset the height to zero as it approaches the overflow threshold and increment the \"generation\" or \"life\" by 1, thus maintaining the system's progression into this far future. This proposal not only addresses the immediate issue of block height overflow but also squares the lifespan of the Bitcoin system, ensuring its functionality and maintaining consistent block subsidy through inconceivable technological eras.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCAmount GetBlockSubsidy(unsigned long long nGen, unsigned long long nHeight, const Consensus::Params& consensusParams) {\r\n\r\n\tif (nHeight >= 64 * nSubsidyHalvingInterval && nHeight < numeric_limits<unsigned long long>::max())\r\n\t        return 0;\r\n\r\n\tif (nHeight == numeric_limits<unsigned long long>::max()){\r\n\t\tnGen += 1; \r\n\t\tnHeight = 0;\r\n\t\treturn 0;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tunsigned long long halvings = nHeight / nSubsidyHalvingInterval;\r\n\r\n\tCAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;\r\n\t// Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.\r\n\tnSubsidy >>= halvings;\r\n\treturn nSubsidy;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include

      "body": "Hi @maflcko \r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nI would like to emphasize that while some bugs may seem similar or less urgent than others, it is best practice in software development to address each bug individually. This ensures that each issue is thoroughly investigated and resolved based on its own merits, rather than being bundled together or deferred due to perceived similarities. The forums you've referenced are predominantly for general Bitcoin inquiries akin to StackOverflow discussions. However, my intent is not to pose a question but rather to report a glaring code flaw (See BIP42).\r\n\r\nAddressing bugs only when they become operationally critical may not be the most prudent approach. In software development, especially in a system as foundational as Bitcoin, proactive bug resolution is key to maintaining trust and reliability.\r\n\r\nWhile I could initiate a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) or submit a Pull Request (PR), I must admit that I lack the necessary Bitcoin expertise and time to adequately address the issue across the entire affected codebase. Therefore, I am deferring to you and the rest of the Bitcoin developer community, who possess the required skills and resources to devise the best solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nThe generational issue I mentioned serves to highlight the problem and the clear limitations within Bitcoin's code due to the use of small data types. It is not intended to be a serious proposal, but rather, it is an example of a broader concern. I also do not suggest that an issue should be opened for every instance where block height might overflow, nor do I expect Bitcoin code reviewers to do so. Simply identifying and documenting the problem along with the affected code areas for future consideration should suffice.\r\n\r\nIn my view, the arguments presented seem more like a pretext to diminish the visibility of the issue, rather than confronting it directly.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nKino",

      "body": "> Addressing bugs only when they become operationally critical may not be the most prudent approach.\r\n\r\nI did not say or imply this. I said that fixing an issue in a code base that is expected to stop working in 2106, for an issue that is expected to happen in thousands of years is useless at best. In practice, a fix now would most likely result in a increased runtime load  or increased memory load, along with the risk of a consensus and chain split. Also, the C++ language is evolving rapidly right now, so any fix today could very well turn out entirely unused or suboptimal. Also, Bitcoin Core is evolving as a software project, so it is possible that a fix will happen as a side-effect of another future change \"for free\".\r\n\r\nIn any case, this issue is well-known, obvious and trivial to re-dicscover. If there is interest to fix the issue, or if an acceptable solution is found, it will be proposed. There is no need to keep this tracking issue open. In fact, leaving this open will just serve as a distraction from real issues that are happening to users today.",

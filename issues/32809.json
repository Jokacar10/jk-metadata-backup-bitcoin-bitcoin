    "title": "Reduce Bitcoin Network Energy Consumption for Environmental Sustainability",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nHello,\n\nI would like to open a feature request or initiate a discussion around the possibility of reducing the overall energy consumption of the Bitcoin network.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has proven its resilience and decentralization through proof-of-work (PoW), the current energy requirements to secure the network are significant. This has raised growing concerns regarding its environmental impact, especially in the context of global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nKey Points:\n\nHigh Energy Demand: The Bitcoin network consumes more energy annually than some entire countries. This energy usage is mostly due to the PoW mining mechanism.\n\nEnvironmental Concerns: A large portion of mining operations still rely on fossil fuels, increasing the carbon footprint of the network.\n\nPublic Image and Adoption: Bitcoin's environmental footprint is often cited as a barrier to wider adoption and public acceptance, particularly among environmentally-conscious users, regulators, and institutions.\n\nLong-Term Sustainability: Exploring ways to make the network more energy-efficient could help ensure its viability in an increasingly carbon-regulated global economy.\n\n\nPossible Directions:\n\nResearch on protocol-level optimizations that reduce energy intensity without compromising decentralization or security.\n\nEncourage community dialogue about the future of PoW and the possibility of alternative consensus models or enhancements to make mining more sustainable.\n\nIncentivize greener mining practices or provide protocol-level support for low-carbon energy sources.\n\n\nThis is not a trivial issue, and any change to Bitcoinâ€™s consensus mechanism must be approached with extreme care. However, opening the conversation and exploring possible paths toward reducing the network's energy demand would be a meaningful step for Bitcoin's future.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nAlexander\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "title": "Change functional tests to trigger reorg by reconsiderblock",
    "body": "### Motivation\n\nWhile working on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32516 I found that for testing mempool entry from reorged blocks, directly using invalidateblock to trigger the reorg has at least a couple behaviors that don't match real reorgs:\n\n1) Only allows 10 deep reorg before it stops trying to re-enter things into the mempool\n2) doesn't respect descendant chain limits(? still unsure how this is happening)\n\nthe code paths greatly diverge from normal re-orgs, which makes this problematic for actual testing.\n\nThe setup being used:\n1) build blockchain of stuff you want re-entry for\n2) invalidatblock to the desired fork off point\n\nOne example to look at would be https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3f83c744ac28b700090e15b5dda2260724a56f49/test/functional/mempool_ephemeral_dust.py#L350 or any other tests in `mempool_*.py` that use invalidateblock to simulate reorgs and mempool re-entry.\n\n\n### Possible solution\n\n\nWe should make sure that in our reorg/mempool tests spread across the codebase that we don't do it this way and instead:\n\n1) Prep fork chain of sufficient length\n2) invalidate the fork chain\n3) do normal test setup\n4) reconsiderblock the previously invalidated chain\n\nThis appears to match the intended test coverage.\n\n### Useful Skills\n\nUnderstanding of python test suite\n\n### Guidance for new contributors\n\nWant to work on this issue?\n\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\n",

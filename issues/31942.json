    "title": "[rfc] build: Reject unclean configure?",
    "body": "When re-configuring a build, it is possible to do so in an unclean way on a stale build folder.\n\nThe average person initiating such a build does not know when a stale build is safe and when not. Time is wasted for the builder when a broken build silently succeeds and then leads to a nonsensical error later on. Just to give the last two examples of the last few days: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31922#issuecomment-2673888781, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31933#discussion_r1966580329, ...)\n\nThe benefit of an unclean build is unclear, given that it merely  saves a few seconds of a build that normally happens in the background anyway, at the risk of wasting minutes or hours if something is overlooked.\n\nThus, a build configure should be rejected if the build directory exists.\n\n(Obviously, re-builds on a build directory that do not require a re-configure are not affected)",

However, I think that change would also break use-cases I think are useful, like being able to update and switch branches and run `make`. I'm not sure exactly what changes you might have in mind though, and if there are other ways of detecting \"unclean\" configurations.\n\nI do think the case where you switch branches while keeping the build is different from the case where you change cmake options while keeping the build. I would expect the former to basically always work and only the latter to be unreliable.\n\n",

Trying to protect the project against those cases means questioning the concept of a cache as such.\n> \n> FWIW, the `find_package()` command creates cache variables when it succeeds. If the dependency package is later removed from the system, a subsequent `cmake` re-run won't detect the change.\n\nIf the cache is known to possibly result in a (silent) break on any change to installed packages, it just doesn't seem worth it. I suspect that updating packages (c.f. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31959#issuecomment-2688263542) happens daily or weekly, so I fail to see how anyone building equally often can even benefit from the cache.\n\nAnyone building several times a day and really wanting to use the cache can trivially set `ALLOW_CONFIGURE_ON_UNCLEAN_BUILD_DIR`.\n\nIf `ccache` was similarly broken and could fail on any package change or update, it'd be unacceptable (at least to me).

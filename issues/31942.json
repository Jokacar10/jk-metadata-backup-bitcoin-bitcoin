    "title": "[rfc] build: Reject unclean configure?",
    "body": "When re-configuring a build, it is possible to do so in an unclean way on a stale build folder.\n\nThe average person initiating such a build does not know when a stale build is safe and when not. Time is wasted for the builder when a broken build silently succeeds and then leads to a nonsensical error later on. Just to give the last two examples of the last few days: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31922#issuecomment-2673888781, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31933#discussion_r1966580329, ...)\n\nThe benefit of an unclean build is unclear, given that it merely  saves a few seconds of a build that normally happens in the background anyway, at the risk of wasting minutes or hours if something is overlooked.\n\nThus, a build configure should be rejected if the build directory exists.\n\n(Obviously, re-builds on a build directory that do not require a re-configure are not affected)",

However, I think that change would also break use-cases I think are useful, like being able to update and switch branches and run `make`. I'm not sure exactly what changes you might have in mind though, and if there are other ways of detecting \"unclean\" configurations.\n\nI do think the case where you switch branches while keeping the build is different from the case where you change cmake options while keeping the build. I would expect the former to basically always work and only the latter to be unreliable.\n\n",

    "title": "[rfc] build: Reject unclean configure?",
    "body": "When re-configuring a build, it is possible to do so in an unclean way on a stale build folder.\n\nThe average person initiating such a build does not know when a stale build is safe and when not. Time is wasted for the builder when a broken build silently succeeds and then leads to a nonsensical error later on. Just to give the last two examples of the last few days: (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31922#issuecomment-2673888781, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31933#discussion_r1966580329, ...)\n\nThe benefit of an unclean build is unclear, given that it merely  saves a few seconds of a build that normally happens in the background anyway, at the risk of wasting minutes or hours if something is overlooked.\n\nThus, a build configure should be rejected if the build directory exists.\n\n(Obviously, re-builds on a build directory that do not require a re-configure are not affected)",

However, I think that change would also break use-cases I think are useful, like being able to update and switch branches and run `make`. I'm not sure exactly what changes you might have in mind though, and if there are other ways of detecting \"unclean\" configurations.\n\nI do think the case where you switch branches while keeping the build is different from the case where you change cmake options while keeping the build. I would expect the former to basically always work and only the latter to be unreliable.\n\n",

Trying to protect the project against those cases means questioning the concept of a cache as such.\n> \n> FWIW, the `find_package()` command creates cache variables when it succeeds. If the dependency package is later removed from the system, a subsequent `cmake` re-run won't detect the change.\n\nIf the cache is known to possibly result in a (silent) break on any change to installed packages, it just doesn't seem worth it. I suspect that updating packages (c.f. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31959#issuecomment-2688263542) happens daily or weekly, so I fail to see how anyone building equally often can even benefit from the cache.\n\nAnyone building several times a day and really wanting to use the cache can trivially set `ALLOW_CONFIGURE_ON_UNCLEAN_BUILD_DIR`.\n\nIf `ccache` was similarly broken and could fail on any package change or update, it'd be unacceptable (at least to me).

      "body": "> The word \"unclean\" is vague and has negative connotations, and the option seems to be disallowing all incremental builds that touch CMakeLists.txt files, which happen all the time when you switch branches and do work very well in my experience.\n\nThe wording is intentional. It is intentional to not only rule out incremental builds that touch the configure files. There is other stuff that could be leading to issues. Obviously, I can't produce a full list, so being vague is intentional. For example:\n\n* Coverage builds may leave behind coverage data in the build dir, which is not cleaned after an \"incremental build\". This can create problems where it is not possible to map the data back to the source code meaningfully. It could also lead to misleading results when it is possible to map the (stale) data back to the source code.\n* The same may be true for other (non-coverage) artefacts\n* All docs in this repo denote a single build dir `./build` for all builds (except for the cmake presets file). This can create problems when a non-feature build is done on top of a feature build. For example, a non-gui build is done on top of a gui build and a stale gui executable is left behind silently. Another example would be where a re-configure doesn't have any effect and cmake just prefers to silently use the cache.\n* The cmake cache is fragile and does not detect system package updates, so it can lead to arbitrary problems.\n* Having a stale binary in the `build/src` folder, as opposed to the `build/bin` folder.\n* ... etc\n\nAll of the known and unknown issues are trivial to avoid with a clean build at minimal cost. Whereas running into any of the issues silently, or fixing each of the them individually and completely in some way or another, seems like a drain of time.",

We've also started adding notes to some docs to remove build dirs before configuring, and if this is what we are going to do, we should start doing this consistently, or not at all.",

As a developer, you want to make a change, run `make` (or press a key/button in your IDE) and get feedback as fast as possible. No unnecessary commands should be executed.\n\n* If the change is in a source file, that file alone is recompiled. Only the targets that use the file are relinked.\n* If the change is in a header file, only files that include this header (directly or indirectly) are recompiled.\n* If the change is in a `CMakeLists.txt` file, because you added a source file or a dependency to a target, the buildsystem is automatically regenerated.\n\nMultiple levels of caching are in place to achieve this:\n\n* Output files lingering in the build directory (object files, generated files, etc).\n* Optionally a compiler cache (`ccache`).\n* Generated buildsystem (`Makefile`, etc).\n* CMake cache (`CMakeCache.txt`).\n\nIn case of unexpected errors, individual caches can be cleared:\n\n* Output files: `make clean`\n* Compiler cache: `ccache --clear`\n* Buildsystem: `cmake .`\n* CMake cache: `cmake --fresh`\n* Output files + Buildsystem + CMake cache: `rm -rf build`\n\nBeing able to clear the CMake cache without clearing the output files can be useful. Just as it can be useful to clear the output files without clearing the compiler cache.\n\nOf course, `make clean` only deletes files that the build system knows about. Example: If you remove an `add_library`/`add_executable` (either by deleting the respective code from a `CMakeLists.txt` file or by setting a condition that has the effect that the call is no longer reached), build artefacts of that target may not be removed. But this should not cause any problems. If it does, it may be considered a bug in the project. One way to cause such problems is the use of [`file(GLOB)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/file.html#glob) to get a list of files in the build directory.\n\nAny enforcement to delete any of the caches creates impediments in the developer workflow by making it slower than necessary.",

      "body": "> It'd be good if @hebasto or @purpleKarrot could clarify exactly what the expected CMake behaviour is meant to be.\n\nCMake internally distinguishes between \"the first invocation on this build tree\" and \"consequent invocations on the same build tree\".\n\nFor example:\n```\n$ rm -rf build\n$ cmake -B build --toolchain depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/toolchain.cmake\n// no warnings\n$ cmake -B build --toolchain depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/toolchain.cmake\n<snip>\n-- Configuring done (0.2s)\n-- Generating done (0.0s)\nCMake Warning:\n  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:\n\n    CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE\n\n\n-- Build files have been written to: /home/hebasto/dev/bitcoin/build\n```\n\nAs a result, the `--fresh` option was [introduced](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests/7099) to [\"pretend this is the first invocation on this build tree\"](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/23119).\n\nCMake developers [say](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/23119):\n> Sometimes users want to re-run CMake from scratch as if the build tree were never before processed.\n\nwhich [means](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/23119#note_1231595):\n>  It is just that this workflow is never officially documented but it is massively important for large CMake projects.\n\nWhile working on the build system, I typically run `rm -rf build && cmake -B build` by default. Since it's possible to maintain multiple build trees, it seems prudent to recommend that users always start from a fresh build tree.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nFrom [Professional CMake: A Practical Guide 20th Edition](https://discourse.cmake.org/t/professional-cmake-a-practical-guide-20th-edition/13394), Ch. 14.7. Discarding Previous Results:\n> When trying to track down unexpected behavior in the CMake logic of a project, a recommended debugging step is to discard any cached results from an existing build directory...\n>\n> The `CMakeCache.txt` file in the top of the build directory is the primary place where information is cached. In some scenarios, the developer may need to delete this file so that cached information is recomputed, or manual changes discarded. Examples where the file should be removed include:\n>    * A dependency may have been updated or removed.\n>    * A cache variable the developer added or modified temporarily might no longer be needed and the defaults should be used instead.\n>    * The compiler or other tools associated with the toolchain might have been updated or changed.\n>    * The developer wants to switch to a different CMake generator.\n> \n> If anything about the toolchain changes, the `CMakeFiles` directory should also be removed. This is where CMake caches toolchain information after performing various checks on the first run.",

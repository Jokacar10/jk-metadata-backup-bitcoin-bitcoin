    "title": "Moving this repo to bitcoin-core",
    "body": "Organizationally, it doesn't make sense for Bitcoin Core to be under the bitcoin GitHub organization. All of our other repos (gui, qa-assets, dev wiki, etc.) are under bitcoin-core, so having just this one repo in a different organization doesn't totally make sense. It's only in bitcoin/ for historical reasons. The bitcoin-core organization was created several years ago for the express purpose of moving this repo there, but we still haven't done it.\n\nConceptually, it makes sense to complete the move as it gives further strength to the fact that Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin. This move also provides us with some organizational benefits, primarily in the form of not having to keep two organization member and team lists in sync.\n\nAdditionally, because bitcoin and bips are under the same bitcoin github org, there are some questions about moderation and banning of people from either repo. A ban from one repo is necessarily a ban from both as bans are issued by the organization, not the repo. However, since Bitcoin Core and BIPs are separate projects, this type of behavior does not make any sense, and both projects should be able to make their own moderation decisions without impacting the other. By moving one or both repos out of the bitcoin github org, this conflict can be resolved.\n\nWhen a repository is transferred, github will automatically create redirects for all of the URLs, including git remotes. This move would not affect anyone's workflows, nor would it break any existing links to bitcoin/bitcoin. The only requirement is that a bitcoin/bitcoin repository is not created after the move. This necessitates that the current owners of the bitcoin github organization will remain the owners of it in order to prevent any takeovers of the redirects.\n\nA related but tangential topic is whether bips should move to its own organization as well, and the bitcoin github org can remain under current ownership to preserve redirects for both repos.\n\n***\n\nThis was discussed during today's IRC meeting: https://achow101.com/ircmeetings/2025/bitcoin-core-dev.2025-04-24_16_00.log.html\n\nThe general sentiment seems to be in favor of this move, although it seems like there are still some reservations about doing so. I'm opening this issue for additional long form discussion. This will also be a topic in next week's IRC meeting.",

      "body": "One concern that was brought up during the IRC meeting is whether github might recycle the bitcoin org if it were to have no activity. This would be problematic as if it were recycled this opens up the possibility of scammers to create a new bitcoin/bitcoin that points to something malicious. However, several contributors have tried to get github to release inactive usernames and organizations with extreme difficulty, and generally unable to actually get them to do that, so I think this risk is relatively low. It seems that github actually is quite reluctant to release usernames or organization names, although it supposedly has happened before. I believe that it can be further mitigated by adding a readme to the organization profile that states the purpose of the organization being inactive so that redirects are preserved.\n\nThere was also the concern that github may decide to break redirects in the future, for whatever reason. While we can't know what github will do in the future, their past behavior with transferred repositories is that the redirects are permanent as long as there is no repo of the same name created in the original org. Several contributors have transferred repositories before (even out of the bitcoin org too) and all of those redirects still remain.",

I do agree that these threads are really unlikely, but the implications are massive when compared to the benefits of splitting the orgs. \n\nIf the main motivation is making moderation easier, moving out the bips repository and leaving bitcoin under the bitcoin org seems a less risky option.",

Even if it were to happen, it would be trivial to ask GitHub staff to re-instantiate the redirect.\n* GitHub could delete/reassign the org: This also seems theoretical, because it is not known to have ever happened to a meaningful/relevant org. Also, the proposal of having an org-readme to clearly and briefly document the redirect and the expectation that the redirect will persist, along with keeping the admin/owner team in the org, should be sufficient additional safeguards.\n\n",

BIPs are protocol-level standards, independent of any specific implementation (imho). Relocating BIPs to the bitcoin core organization would blur this separation, contradicting the principle that Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin. \n\nKeeping the BIPS will also make the move of the bitcoin repo to bitcoin core organization an easy to explain action. Makes bitcoin org github independent  and support the fact that \"that Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin\". \n\nAlso keeping the BIP's on bitcoin github org , will keep the bitcoin repo active.\n\nEDIT: bitcoin.org github -> bitcoin github org",

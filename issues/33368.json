To me this change should be at least postponed. If not, I guess it can be concluded that the people controlling Bitcoin Core have been compromised in some way, which I consider a very bad thing. Bitcoin is supposed to be what Satoshi intended, no matter that some changes may be accepted by the community. But it should be supported by the far majority of the community and this OP_RETURN limit removal is definitely not supported by the vast Bitcoin community.",

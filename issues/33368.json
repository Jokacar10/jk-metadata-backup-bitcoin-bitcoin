To me this change should be at least postponed. If not, I guess it can be concluded that the people controlling Bitcoin Core have been compromised in some way, which I consider a very bad thing. Bitcoin is supposed to be what Satoshi intended, no matter that some changes may be accepted by the community. But it should be supported by the far majority of the community and this OP_RETURN limit removal is definitely not supported by the vast Bitcoin community.",

You can run the tests with [this script](https://gist.github.com/jonasnick/cd52b4463b720a5fb1406c2cbabaf936) (requires nix).\n\nIt seems like Cap'n Proto is a new dependency.

Ran through all the features from the testing guide:\n\n- Datacarrier size: Created a transaction with 83 bytes of data in an OP_RETURN output and successfully sent it\n- bitcoin command: Used `bitcoin node` to start a node and `bitcoin rpc` to make RPC calls - unified interface works well\n- Bumpfee: Created a transaction and successfully used `bumpfee` with `replaceable: false`\n- TRUC: Created replaceable transactions with different fee rates\n- IPC mining: Started the node with IPC enabled and confirmed the `node.sock` file was created\n- Coinstatsindex: Started v29.1 with coinstatsindex, then v30.0rc1, and confirmed both folders existed",

    "title": "Why bitcoin use so many RecursiveMutex",
    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nI have noticed that in the Bitcoin source code, almost all thread-safe sections use RecursiveGuard.\nAs we all know, RecursiveGuard is exclusive, which can impact system performance and concurrency.\n\nAt the same time, I have also noticed https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19303 specifically tracking the replacement of RecursiveMutex with Mutex, which would help reduce some of the locking overhead.\n\nHowever, I think Mutex is still exclusive. For modules like the transaction pool, which involve both reading and writing transactionsâ€”such as querying pending transactions and inserting new ones.\n\nwouldn't using a read-write lock (SharedMutex) directly provide better performance? If I make this kind of modification, is it officially recommended?\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

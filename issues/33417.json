    "title": "Test interface_ipc.py fails with Duplicate ID error when libmultiprocess is installed system-wide",
    "body": "When I tried to run the `interface_ipc.py` functional test it failed with the error:\n```\n2025-09-17T08:33:50.642653Z TestFramework (INFO): PRNG seed is: 5837581670543711780\n2025-09-17T08:33:50.643144Z TestFramework (INFO): Initializing test directory /tmp/bitcoin_func_test_qg32uhlp\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'kj::ExceptionImpl'\n  what():  mp/proxy.capnp:0: failed: Duplicate ID @0xcc316e3f71a040fb.\nAborted (core dumped)\n```\nAfter further investigating the issue I found that when I have the `libmultiprocess` library installed system wide this test is failing, and removing the library from the system will make the test run as normal.\nThe main reason for this is the `load_capnp_modules` function, which imports certain files and libraries. Here is the breakdown for the issue:\n1) If you have already installed `capnp` globally on your system. The function will detect it and add the whole path of the `/include` directory of your system. Which contains all other libraries of your system including `capnp` and `mp` (if installed system-wide) library.\n2. This line of code `mp_dir = src_dir / \"ipc\" / \"libmultiprocess\" / \"include\"` includes the path of `libmultiprocess` directory inside the Bitcoin source tree.\n3. Now, when the `capnp.load()` function parses the imports, it will see multiple declarations of the same file. The first implementation was included from the `/include` path (as this is also the default path for the `libmultiprocess` library when you install system-wide) and secondly from the Bitcoin internal source tree.\n\n### How to reproduce\nTo reproduce the error you must have `capnp` and `libmultiprocess` installed system wide. \n\n### Possible Solution\nOne possible solution is to track when we have `libmultiprocess` installed system-wide or not. If it's installed system-wide, then don't add the one from the Bitcoin source tree.",

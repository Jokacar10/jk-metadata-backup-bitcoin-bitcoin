    "title": "Linux download needs installation instructions",
    "body": "Windows has an installer, macOS has the usual drag-me-to-application logic that most GUI users will be familiar with. But for Linux we just give people are bunch of binaries along with a README that lacks any installation instructions.\n\nWorse, it turns out the binaries don't work out of the box on a vanilla Ubuntu system. That's not just because of Wayland, which we don't support yet. Even on X11 it will miss certain libraries.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/14m8f9q/missing_required_library_to_run_core_on_ubuntu/\n\nhttps://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/122646/libxcb-xinerama0-library-required-by-bitcoin-qt\n\nThe easiest fix would be to point to https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#other-linux-gui which at least gives some general instructions.\n\nBetter I think would be to add instructions for the most popular desktop distros.\n\nI think it's fine to assume that daemon users can figure it out for themselves.",

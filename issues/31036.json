    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\nConnections to port 8333 can be recognized right away as Bitcoin P2P connections. While it is still possible to recognize Bitcoin P2P connections regardless of the port, random ports would make network-wide monitoring harder.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nNetwork-wide monitoring.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe listening address and port of a node are propagated and saved in other nodes' databases, so the port has to be constant. Thus, after generating a random port it would need to be saved on disk (e.g. `settings.json`) and reused after restarts.\r\n\r\nThis applies to new installations. Existent ones have already propagated with port 8333 (if not changed by the node operator). So, something like: if a new installation and port is not explicitly provided, instead of using 8333 generate a random one and save it to `settings.json`.\r\n\r\nThis applies only to listening on IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nThis is more of a network-wide measure. Individual nodes have stronger means to protect themselves.",

[Historical data](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/hardcoded-seeds-dns-seeds-and-darknet-nodes/1123) suggests this could be feasible, even more so because the number of hardcoded seed addresses can be increased at virtually no cost.

      "body": "Concept ACK.\r\n\r\nRegarding DNS seeds, I think there is a 3rd option, which I favor. We keep the DNS seeds, but treat them always as addrfetch peers, rather than as names to resolve directly. This is what already happens when you're running in tor-only mode: a P2P connection is made \"to\" the DNS seed name at port 8333 (i.e., the Tor exit node resolves the name for us, picks one of the IP addresses it resolves to, establishes a connection to it, and forwards it to us without revealing what that IP was), and we send a GETADDR message to it and insert the results into adrman.\r\n\r\nThis obviously isn't possible in I2P-only or tor-hidden-service-only setups (which will need to rely on hardcoded seeds instead), but I believe it will keep functioning fine for tor-only setups. As long as a decent portion of port-8333 nodes remains, they will keep getting found by the DNS seeders, and get queried (but, due to the extra indirection step, what actually ends up in addrman can have any port, as well as any service flags, ...). Longer term, seeders could become P2P based, if need be.\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n* Loses the caching effect that ISP resolvers have on DNS seeds (in honest operation, this reduces the load on DNS seeds somewhat).\r\n* If the network evolves to a point where barely anyone runs 8333 anymore (or only spy nodes...?), this is not a final solution.\r\n* Depending on how DNS seeders evolve, this may lose the advantage that the seeders do not observe the IP address of new nodes starting up (by being hidden behind ISP resolvers).\r\n\r\nUpsides:\r\n* Gets to distribute everything that ADDRV2 can encode (any BIP155 network type, port number, service flags).\r\n* If v2 connections get used, this removes ISP ability to gratuitously observe Bitcoin node IP addresses being distributed to new nodes starting up (assuming no ISP-operation Bitcoin-specific full connection MitM).\r\n",

      "body": "Besides the load, which can be dealt with by having a large number of seeds, i wonder how much getting rid of the DNS caching impacts \"privacy\", loosely defined. Of course from the perspective of a node, if you want to hide your IP you use an anonymizing network period. But it's also the case that being a P2P seed gives you a privileged observation position on all the nodes joining the network, which is less true for DNS seeds since most of the time the bootstrapping nodes would not actually connect to them directly. Can this be also dealt with by having a large number of seed nodes such as if every node joining the network picks randomly from the list you only get to observe very few of them? If so how many *reachable* seeds is enough? And at what rate do they decay?\r\n\r\nOf course this drawback needs to be considered on balance with all the advantages brought by seeding through the Bitcoin protocol instead of DNS:\r\n- Makes it possible to leverage BIP324 transport\r\n- Makes it possible to have seeds for anonymizing networks\r\n- Removes DNS as a build time dependency (it could help releasing static builds against musl for instance)\r\n- Works fine in a future where most nodes on the network listen on a random port",

      "body": "@darosior, good observations and questions! Maybe use the P2P-seeds only as a fallback if it takes too long?\r\n\r\nI mean this - right now there are around 2000 hardcoded addresses in `contrib/seeds/nodes_main.txt`. Some of them will be down, thus the problem mentioned above: \"Another downside would be that finding an initial batch of peers would take longer\". So, maybe if a new node can't find enough peers in some reasonable time from those 2000 (and GETADDR replies if it manages to connect to some of them), only then fallback to the P2P-seeds (that have high quality GETADDR responses). This way P2P-seeds will not see every new node. That plus having a lot of P2P seeds should mitigate the privacy issue of having a P2P seeder know all newly joining nodes.",

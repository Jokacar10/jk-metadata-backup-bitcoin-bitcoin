    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nWe would like to be able to send untrusted utxos via the sendtoaddress API.\n\nCurrently, we have to go through the createrawtransaction flow to achieved this.\n\nWhile I understand why it may be a sane default to have not to allow that, there is also very good reasons. Bitcoin Core may assume that a coin is \"untrusted\" because it is unconfirmed and is not change, but it doesn't know that this coins is actually coming from a separate wallet that is also owned by the receiver.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA config that allows to send untrusted utxos via the sendtoaddress api. Otherwise, always allow sending untrusted utxos via the sendtoaddress api by default.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nThe create raw transaction flow. However we prefer relying on the sendtoaddress flow we currently use.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

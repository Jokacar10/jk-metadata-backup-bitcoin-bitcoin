    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nPut back full support for  Berkeley 4.8 wallets.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nPossible wallet corruption (when opening with other versions of Berkeley)\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nPut back full support for Berkeley 4.8 (and other?) wallets.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nI heard there are conversion tools, but these would be difficult to use for people just wanting to run a node and keep their current (old) Bitcoin wallet.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nI can imagine the developer's side of removing support for the old wallets using Berkeley 4.8. However, isn't one of the things people holding Bitcoin want is hold it for a long time? I think it is important to make sure older wallets can just be opened in the default Bitcoin node and wallet software.\n\nThis issue relates to \"The Bitcoin Devs\" not supporting \"Bitcoin as it is supposed to be\" according to the more purist Bitcoiners, as it seems Bitcoin Core developers seem to focus on 'nice development' instead of 'making the default Bitcoin node (and wallet) software.\n\nAnyhow, I think it is important to make sure older wallets can be just imported, instead of being 'converted' with some conversion tool, with all hassles and risks related to it. I also understand different Berkeley versions could corrupt wallets while doing downgrades and I think it is of major importance to avoid something .like that. Isn't Bitcoin Core in the end important because of Bitcoin in wallets?\n",

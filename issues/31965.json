    "title": "Revisiting us self-hosting parts of our CI",
    "body": "The project currently self-hosts the runners for ~half of our CI jobs. The other half of the CI jobs run on GitHub Actions hosted by GitHub. In an offline discussion, the question came up if we should move the self-hosted runners to some other non-self-hosted infrastructure or if there are other ways to improve on the following areas:\n\n- reduce infrastructure maintenance burden: someone has to take care of the servers, but that's (normally) not too much work. Shouldn't be a single person maintaining it to reduce the bus-factor and single point of failures. \n- increase performance: generally faster CI is welcome, maybe solvable with more CPU, but also related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30852 - not clear yet what exactly is targeted - and performance could be improved with self-hosted CI too - no need to go non-self-hosted for this alone.\n- increase security/robustness: generally, running public jobs CI on self-hosted hardware is a security risk and [not recommended](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security) - making it (more) secure is possible, but probably a lot of work that we might want to outsource to e.g. a company that specializes on it\n\nCurrently, the self-hosted CI has implicit caches for docker images, ccache, depends (sources and built). Caching would need to be implemented on non-selfhosted runners too. Some more discussion about the implicit caches is [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30852#issuecomment-2558198430).\n\nSome mentioned ideas, but there are probably more approaches worth exploring:\n- Github Actions: move all jobs to GitHub actions. GitHub cache is limited to 10GB, which is too small. PR authors can't rerun PRs. Even more dependency on GitHub/Microsoft, but we already have half of the jobs there.  \nSee also [#30304 ci: Move more tasks to GHA?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30304).\n- runson.com: would need to move the cirrus jobs to GitHub Actions format. Allows to use a way bigger cache, potentially cheaper than GitHub actions?\n- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): bring our own machines for a kubernetes cluster, or rent pods on demand and let the controller spin up things for new jobs. In theory, helps with performance and probably with security. Would need to move from Cirrus to GitHub Actions.\n- [Cirrus-CI on Cloud machines](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/supported-computing-services/): use cloud machines and keep Cirrus. Needs us to figure out caching.\n- [bitcoin-core-cirrus-runner](https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin-core-cirrus-runner): is a experimental NixOS module that runs jobs in a isolated, ephemeral, and minimal QEMU VM. Would still be self-hosted CI, does address some of the security concerns about the current CI, not production ready yet, and probably a more complex solutions that wound't reduce maintenance burden in the long run.\n- Keep status status quo: use self-hosted, persistent, but potentially insecure Cirrus runners - \"if it ain't broken, don't fix it\"",

They will also often provide their own caching options.\n\nI quite like the idea of all of CI being defined as Github Actions which means all jobs should be runnable on forks (if a little slower as they wouldn't be on bigger runners).\n\nAssuming we were happy to migrate the jobs to Github Actions, the next consideration is which runners to use: \n\nTo put this on a spectrum of easy -> hard to administer and maintain it would be:\n\n[Github's runners ](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories)-> [BuildJet](https://buildjet.com/for-github-actions) -> [runs-on.com](https://runs-on.com/) -> [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller)\n\nThen to consider the cost per minute from expensive -> inexpensive on an 8 core runner:\n\n[Github's runners $0.032](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) -> [actions-runner-controller $??](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller) -> [BuildJet $0.016](https://buildjet.com/for-github-actions/docs/about/pricing) -> [runs-on.com $0.0034](https://runs-on.com/pricing/)\n\nActions runner controller is hard to estimate cost as it would depend on the autoscaling of the k8s cluster.\n\nIt's my opinion that the sweet spot between cost and administration burden is between `BuildJet` and `Runs-On`. `BuildJet` requires almost no administration and `Runs-On` advertises as only needing a few hours a year but I think we should imagine that there would need to be a few people comfortable enough with AWS to fix things once a year or so if something goes wrong. Runs-On is provisioned using a Cloud Formation template.\n\nAssuming we have enough people happy to administer a runs-on.com AWS stack (I would be) then I think this is perhaps worth exploring moving jobs there. If people want as little administration as possible, perhaps we should look at BuildJet (or equivalents)",

      "body": "Thanks for the survey and summary, as well as the additional input on this topic!\n\nI don't have a strong opinion on this, and anything is probably fine, as long as it \"works\".\n\nJust some random thoughts:\n\n* The GHA runners that are included for public repositories are likely too weak to run all of the CI tasks in the maximum timeout (apart from the cache being too small as well, as mentioned above). So the goal that more of the CI tasks can run on forks trivially may not be achievable.\n* The 32-bit arm CI task (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/4637cb1eec48d1af8d23eeae1bb4c6f8de55eed9/ci/test/00_setup_env_arm.sh#L9-L10) likely can't run on any of the mentioned alternatives? It should be possible to drop the 32-bit mode from the task, emulate it (slower), or move it to a \"nightly\" task. However, another CI task may be added in the future that requires special hardware that isn't available. So the goal that all tasks are moved to a single provider/hoster and will stay there may not be achievable without further changes to the CI tasks.\n* The \"server-part\" of CI maintenance with persistent runners is a smaller chunk of work. The majority of CI issues are unrelated to the infra and will have to fixed regardless of where the CI runs. Roughly, they can be found via the \"CI failed\" label: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=label%3A%22CI%20failed%22%20is%3Aissue\n* It should be easy to increase the CI capacity (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30852) with the current setup, but probably not worth to look into, given that the direction isn't clear yet.\n\nHowever, I haven't confirmed my thoughts by doing a full test of all available options. (I don't really have the time to create accounts for each cloud provider (GCE/AWS/AZ), then an account for each CI provider (ARC/runs-on/build-jet/...), and  come up with the CI config specific to each provider ...). If someone wants to take a look here, I am happy to answer questions and review pull requests.  As mentioned above, anything that \"works\" should be fine and the requirements are:\n\n* All current CI tasks should be covered fully, only dropping coverage where it is reasonable and required.\n* Caching, as mentioned by @0xB10C above. Specifically, The msan task needs some kind of caching (likely docker build layer caching?), as it is not possible to do without: See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31850#issuecomment-2670983217. All other tasks can probably do without install caching, but they need depends caching and ccache caching. (depends and ccache caching is required, because most CI tasks have a 100% hit-rate, according to https://0xb10c.github.io/bitcoin-core-ci-stats/graph/ccache/ and reducing it will likely result in a longer run-time)\n\nIf someone has a proof-of-concept (or two), I'd say it should be fine to apply it to one (or two) CI tasks for a month to see how it goes on `master`, and then revert it within one month, or apply it to other tasks as well.",

Main difference is also that it's fixed price for unlimited minutes per month hence we buy servers off traditional cloud like AWS/GCP/Azure.",

      "body": "Hmm, so I looked into re-running GHA CI tasks to catch silent merge conflicts. However, GitHub does not allow this and blocks any re-run if the push is older than 30 days. Even if the task has been recently re-run. Example: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/actions/runs/16022448902/job/47185933876?pr=32856 (can not be re-run anymore)\n\nIf the ability to re-run CI tasks is removed without replacement, this will likely lead to more pull requests being merged into master, where the CI fails.\n\nThe solution by GitHub is to use \"merge trains\", which is incompatible with our merge process.\n\nAny ideas on how to handle this?",

Maybe if we have a workflow that is also triggered by the `labeled` activity when some \"periodic CI\" label is added. Then DrahtBot can add that label to PRs to run a particular task again?\n\nMaybe we could use https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch to make a workflow that can only be triggered manually, and this would be what DrahtBot runs periodically?

      "body": "> I quite like the idea of all of CI being defined as Github Actions\n\nI prefer the idea that all CI is decoupled from the project, and that both the project and the CI are implemented against a defined interface: the cmake project definition. I presented this approach at C++Now 2025 as [Effective CTest](https://schedule.cppnow.org/session/2025/effective-ctest/).\n\nDefining CI in a YAML file that is part of the project essentially states \"it works on my machine(s)\". The project will start to support variables that are defined in the CI configuration only and it will derive from the default cmake workflow (example: running ctest directly will fail and a special script or a custom target is required to run all tests).\n\nA better approach is to define several CI build scripts that are project independent and then run the same CI scripts on a wide range of projects. Also: Ensure that all projects are CI script agnostic. Ideally, aggregate build results from external parties on a common dashboard.",

    "title": "`dumptxoutset` rollback feature does not take forks into account",
    "body": "In the `dumptxoutset` RPC, when the rollback feature is used with a height H, it will issue an `InvalidateBlock` on the active-chain block at height H+1. However, if an inactive branch of the chain exists that forks off at height H or below, and extends to block H+1 or later (or has equivalent PoW to that), `InvalidateBlock` will reorg there, and dump will be for the tip of that branch, rather than the height-H ancestor of the main chain.\n\nI have not tested this to verify, so it is possible I am missing something.",

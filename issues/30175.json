    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nDescriptor wallets currently do not support the \"legacy\" import commands `importprivkey`, `importpubkey`, `importaddress`, `addmultisigaddress`, `importmulti`, and `importwallet`. This was done because the semantics of these RPC cannot be replicated in descriptor wallets, as they just fundamentally work differently (being explicit about what to watch rather than \"whatever matches the bag of keys and scripts we have\").\r\n\r\nI want to suggest the possibility to reconsider that. The exact semantics cannot be replicated, but ignoring that, for many of these RPCs, the almost certain intent of the RPCs can be replicated:\r\n* `importprivkey` and `importpubkey` can be mapped to a `combo()` descriptor\r\n* `importaddress` can be mapped to an `addr()` descriptor\r\n* `addmultisigaddress` can be mapped to a `multi()` descriptor, wrapped in `sh()`, `sh(wsh())`, or `wsh()` depending on the address type (already returned as the `descriptor` field in the RPC output).\r\n* `importmulti` and `importwallet` are more involved, but do contain enough information for mapping to descriptors.\r\n\r\nFor the simpler ones out of these, it makes sense too. `importprivkey` is simpler to use than learning the descriptor syntax, and no less safe. A reason not to do this is if a user would reasonably expect different semantics, or if there are guides out there that use certain RPCs in a way that relies on the \"bag of keys and scripts\" behavior, but I doubt it. Another reason not to do this is lack of taproot support in these RPCs, though that could be addressed with warnings, or in some cases, extensions (e.g. nothing prevents us from adding a taproot variant to `addmultisigaddress`).\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nI've seen several complaints about how hard `importdescriptors` is in use for importing a private key, or creating a multisig address. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

Forcing users to learn how to craft a descriptor when they merely want to watch an address seems overwhelming to me. -> #27034 maps `importaddress` to `addr()` and `raw()` descriptors. And #28307 fixes and extends `createmultisig`/`addmultisigaddress`.\r\n\r\nNot sure about `importprivkey` as it would clash with the new `void(KEY)` descriptor (#29136). The intent there isn't clear enough to me. Perhaps we could create a `importkey` or `importwalletkey` command where the user can input any type of key and specify its intent in one of the command arguments. Personally, I think the `combo()` descriptor should be more of a last-resort fallback that requires a warning, rather than the user's first choice, as it does not support newer output types.\r\n\r\n",

Given that we do not want to allow exposing child private keys, retaining that behavior would allow extracting specific child private keys in a rather roundabout way (`addmultisigaddress` which puts creates a descriptor with a child privkey, then `listdescriptors true` which outputs the descriptor with that privkey).\r\n\r\nAlso both `addmultisigaddress` and `createmultisig` should allow xpubs and xprvs, currently only single keys are allowed.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that allowing `importmulti` is that useful. All of the stuff that you can do with it can be done with `importdescriptors`, and extremely similarly as `importdescriptors`' interface was based off of `importmulti`. In fact, if importing a descriptor with `importmulti`, the same argument can be used with `importdescriptors`. I suppose someone could be used to `importmulti` with importing all of the other stuff that it allows, but it's quite a mess and doesn't seem like it's used that much? I have seem requests for `importprivkey`, `importaddress`, and `importwallet` for descriptor wallets, but never for `importmulti` for things that `importdescriptors` can't do.\r\n\r\n> Not sure about `importprivkey` as it would clash with the new `void(KEY)` descriptor (#29136).\r\n\r\nI think the distinction is clear enough given `importprivkey`'s historical behavior, and that `void(KEY)` and `addhdkey` would be new. Namely, the expectation is that `importprivkey` imports a private key which produces all of the scripts produced by `combo()`. `void(KEY)` and `addhdkey` explicitly are adding a key that can sign but cannot produce any scripts.",

Yes, the `importdescriptors` interface is non-trivial, but I don't see how the burden can be taken off the user to think about the rescan timestamp of the descriptor. It needs to be accurate, because if it is too late, funds/txs may be missed, if it is too early, hours/days may be spent on a rescan.\r\n\r\nIf this is done, I'd say that `importaddress` should come with a breaking change for descriptor wallets to adjust the rescan argument to be identical in behavior to the one of `importdescriptors`.",

Would it support (participating in) signing for the resulting multisig address (assuming signing for one of specified addresses/pubkeys was possible prior to the RPC call)? Would `listdescriptors true` reveal the corresponding private key?\r\n\r\nThat breaks current invariants in descriptor wallets that have private keys. We enforce that all descriptors being loaded in a wallet with private keys has at least one private key somewhere in that descriptor. So adding the multisig descriptor without any private keys would violate that.",

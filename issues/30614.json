    "body": "In (`miner.cpp`) we set the block (template) timestamp as follows:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\npblock->nTime = TicksSinceEpoch<std::chrono::seconds>(NodeClock::now());\r\n...\r\nUpdateTime(pblock, ...)\r\n\r\n\r\nint64_t UpdateTime(CBlockHeader* pblock, ...)\r\n{\r\n    int64_t nOldTime = pblock->nTime;\r\n    int64_t nNewTime{std::max<int64_t>(pindexPrev->GetMedianTimePast() + 1, TicksSinceEpoch<std::chrono::seconds>(NodeClock::now()))};\r\n\r\n    if (nOldTime < nNewTime) {\r\n        pblock->nTime = nNewTime;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, we pick the system time, and if needed bump it to MTP + 1.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't take the timewarp mitigation for testnet4 into account. The first block must have a timestamp no less than 7200 seconds (2 hours) before the last block. There's discussion about lowering that to 600 from the original proposal.\r\n\r\nAn adversarial miner could set the timestamp 2 hours in the future. The current code would then set the next block at the current time. With the current value of 7200 this should not cause an issue, even if we immediately find a block. But it seems safer to explicitly account for this and increase the timestamp if needed, especially if we ever lower the value.\r\n\r\nWe should also add a functional test that uses fake time to test the limit case: we don't want to end up accepting a block exactly 2 hours in the future and then failing to generate a template because there's no possible valid timestamp due to some off-by-one error. (I don't think this can happen though, haven't thought it through)\r\n\r\nSee also\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1658#issuecomment-2275393864",

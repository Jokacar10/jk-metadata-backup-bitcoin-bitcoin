    "body": "I'm here for the last time, maybe one day I'll share this in the Bitcointalk Altcoin session? Im Youngest Former Pseudonym Group since 2017 and this is just a new Digital Signature offer for Bitcoin because it is still not possible for me to have a Community for the entry requirements of the crypto market... I honestly want this to be realized but please change everything starting from Abstract to Reference, change all sentences in html coding and not for comparison, I hope the offer of Cryptography will be used in the future even if not all the instructions I gave you\nI honestly want this to be realized but please change everything starting from Abstract to Reference, change all sentences in html coding and not for comparison, I hope the offer of Cryptography will be used in the future even though not all the instructions I gave you are.\n\nIt's just Syllogistic Logic Game, I studied axiomatic economics and the law of bias on electros called DC Bias and this has been discussed by several cryptographers, one of which is Christof Paar on the Journal of DPA ON N-BIT, I just solved Gödel's math problems di Byzantine General Problem where natural mistakes can occur unconsciously like you do a backhand in Badminton but what should be your thumb pushing, your wrist is played with but your shoulder is injured even if you keep practicing.\n\nhttps://github.com/FarrelAlFeshall/coin-/issues/1 and regarding Cryptography there it is only Cryptography specifically Checksum but because I myself am the possibility to continue the part that does not exist I leave it to you who are more professional, for Heterodyning there is no need to use or if we want we need QSC01 or Quantum Shieldz Cipher where we create a CLI Module and separate it between tkey loader with storage, Digital Signatures such as ECDSA, EdDSA, CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM this is practically whenever big funds go to Quantum in the sense that it is also called Bit Superposition which because Bit is much more adaptable = Qubits want more ≠ Not proportional to the cost, Sufficient cost = Qubits will still regress because more people want to invest in Bitcoin than have to hack.\n\nAnd this is just Pseudocode \ncoinshamail/cli/main.py\n\nimport argparse, time, secrets, json from qsc01 import H_SAI from wallets.protect_wallet import export_seed, save_encrypted_seed from monitor.ethics_audit import ethics_check from bitcoinrpc.authproxy import AuthServiceProxy, JSONRPCException\n\nBitcoin Core RPC Configuration\n\nrpc_user = \"bitcoinrpc\" rpc_password = \"your_rpc_password\" rpc_port = 8332 rpc_connection = AuthServiceProxy(f\"http://{rpc_user}:{rpc_password}@127.0.0.1:{rpc_port}\")\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"coinشمائل CLI\") parser.add_argument(\"action\", choices=[\"encrypt\", \"decrypt\", \"tx\"], help=\"Action to perform\") parser.add_argument(\"data\", help=\"Seed phrase, wallet path, or tx data\") args = parser.parse_args()\n\nif args.action == \"encrypt\": seed = export_seed(args.data) S = bytes([secrets.randbelow(256) for _ in range(len(seed))]) t = time.time() enc = H_SAI(seed.encode(), t, S) save_encrypted_seed(enc) print(\"Encrypted & saved successfully.\")\n\nelif args.action == \"decrypt\": print(\"Decrypt feature WIP: Requires full chaos match.\")\n\nelif args.action == \"tx\": if ethics_check(args.data): try: tx_data = json.loads(args.data) txid = rpc_connection.sendtoaddress(tx_data[\"address\"], tx_data[\"amount\"]) print(\"Transaction Sent:\", txid) except JSONRPCException as e: print(\"Bitcoin Core Error:\", e) else: print(\"Transaction rejected due to ethical violation.\")\n\nRegards,\n\nFarrel Al Feshal (Youngest former Pseudonym Group)",

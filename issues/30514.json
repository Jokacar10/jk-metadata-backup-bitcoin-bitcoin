However, it seems unrelated to the metadata discussion. At least I fail to see how adding the block height to the metadata in this case helps, when the height is already hardcoded in m_assumeutxo_data. Even if it wasn't, the error message can (and should be) improved for this case, regardless of the metadata contents.

      "body": "I think there was a slight miscommunication. My reply was to your point of a \"large fork\", whose check (currently) happens after the chain params are asked for the hash: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/676abd1af754964858a60fddffb9a12c0a6c2749/src/validation.cpp#L5663 .\r\n\r\nYou also raised a different point about a user downloading a too recent snapshot. This is a different scenario, however the same check in validation will hit it currently. I agree that the error message can be improved in both cases.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to report the height back to the user, I think it should also be fine to just require all headers to be synced to at least include all AU-block-hashes in the chain params. Moving this to be the first check should allow to print an error message about either an ongoing header pre-sync, or a large fork. Once the header pre-sync is done, any block hash can either be resolved to a height, or it is corrupt, or it is from a \"post-AU-params large fork\". Once the correct height is known, it can be used in an any other error message to the user, possibly to tell them which block heights are supported and which block height they asked for.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think the metadata block height can reliably be used to differentiate between a corrupt block hash and a \"post-AU-params large fork\". So using it here, is confusing at best, when the error messages are picked based on the height, which comes from an untrusted source, or may be corrupt as well.\r\n\r\n(I'd say that file corruption is more likely to happen than a large fork, because one requires work, and the other happens by doing nothing and waiting long enough (or doing something trivially low-work actively). So assuming the block height is corrupt as well is the most plausible explanation, or at least it can't be ruled out. However, that knowledge can't be used to rely on.)\r\n\r\nMaybe I am missing something obvious? Generally, it is easier for me to understand C++ code, so if you have the time to write down your idea in code, I am happy to take a look and try to write a test to break it.",

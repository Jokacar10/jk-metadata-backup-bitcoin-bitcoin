    "title": "external signer: PSBT error code `EXTERNAL_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND` is never returned",
    "body": "The error code [`PSBTError::EXTERNAL_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/baa848b8d38187ce6b24a57cfadf1ea180209711/src/common/types.h#L20) is never returned anywhere in our codebase, hence code that handles it (currently done [only in the GUI](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/baa848b8d38187ce6b24a57cfadf1ea180209711/src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp#L458)) is effectively dead. I have never looked deeper into external signing, but at a first glance the two obvious logical choices would be to either:\n* simply get rid of this error code and its handling (if e.g. a more generic error thrown in this case already provides enough information to the user)\n* implement the returning of the error condition; the areas that need to be touched are likely [`ExternalSignerScriptPubKeyMan::GetExternalSigner`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/baa848b8d38187ce6b24a57cfadf1ea180209711/src/wallet/external_signer_scriptpubkeyman.cpp#L48) and its call-site in `::FillPSBT` below\n\n(Noticed while reviewing #31622, where new PSBTError codes are added in the third commit)",

    "body": "I was contacted by someone who runs a lot of nodes that they see the following issue happen very often: After an unclean shutdown an index reports that it is at an unknown best block and the node can not be restarted unless the index is deactivated or resynced.\n\n```\n2025-08-16T12:34:43Z Verification progress: 99%\n2025-08-16T12:34:43Z Verification: No coin database inconsistencies in last 6 blocks (6 transactions)\n2025-08-16T12:34:43Z Block index and chainstate loaded\n2025-08-16T12:34:43Z Opening LevelDB in /bitcoin/testnet3/indexes/txindex\n2025-08-16T12:34:43Z Opened LevelDB successfully\n2025-08-16T12:34:43Z Using obfuscation key for /bitcoin/testnet3/indexes/txindex: 0000000000000000\n2025-08-16T12:34:43Z Opening LevelDB in /bitcoin/testnet3/indexes/coinstats/db\n2025-08-16T12:34:43Z Opened LevelDB successfully\n2025-08-16T12:34:43Z Using obfuscation key for /bitcoin/testnet3/indexes/coinstats/db: 0000000000000000\n2025-08-16T12:34:43Z [error] txindex: best block of the index not found.

I tried through applying targeted asserts and sleeps but either I haven't found the right spot or this is some deeper issue. I'm waiting to receive more infos/logs that might be helpful for triaging.\n\nIn the PR that added this code @mzumsande [already anticipated that this could be an issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25193#issuecomment-1135154066). From taking a look and considering/sketching out some ideas I think the simplest way to fix this might be to go back to the old behavior in `Init` and give the `CustomInit` in coinstatsindex the ability to roll back if it is initialized with an older block. It seems like fixing this was the motivation behind #25193 but I haven't read through all the old conversations yet.",

      "body": "Interesting - I don't understand how this happens: We shouldn't persist the index best block without persisting the block index db right before that (`ChainStateFlushed`), so how can we end up in a situation with the indexes bestblock not being part of the chain, even with an unclean shutdown?\n\nIt would be helpful to know if the corruption (during the unclean shutdown) happened during initial sync phase (`Sync()`) or during the validationinterface signals phase.\n\nOne thing I gather from the reports is that we should make it clearer in the error messages what it means to rebuild an index. Many users appear to do a full reindex, when it would be sufficient to delete the respective index folder (assuming there is nothing wrong with the block tree db, another possibility is that  the indexes are alright, but this is just a symptom of some sort of corruption in that db).\n",

      "body": "I wrote/deleted something incorrect earlier, but I could reproduce this locally now.\nThe issue is that after a reorg,  we call `Commit()` within `BaseIndex::Rewind()`, [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blame/57e8f34fe20620b3350ca1f0fa5c7d8d3a06be82/src/index/base.cpp#L310) without flushing the chainstate. This means, that if a crash/unclean shutdown happens after that for an unrelated reason, the best block of the index data will be a block that wasn't flushed.\n\n> I think the simplest way to fix this might be to go back to the old behavior in Init and give the CustomInit in coinstatsindex the ability to roll back if it is initialized with an older block.\n\nThis would fix the issue above for txindex, but how would we recover the coinstatsindex (the issue that #25193 attempted to fix)? We lost the block indexes necessary for that during the crash (they were never flushed), so we can't roll back through these blocks, and the coinstatindex data will be incorrect.\n\nI think it would be better to simply remove the call to `Commit()` from `BaseIndex::Rewind()`, so that the best block on disk of the index aligns with the flushed chainstate (the commit will happen later, with the next `ChainStateFlushed`).\n\nIn any case would be good to fix this in 30.0, I'll work on a PR to remove the `Commit` call / add a functional test for the situation.\n\nFYI @ryanofsky @furszy  in case you have an opinion.\n",

This means, that if a crash/unclean shutdown happens after that for an unrelated reason, the best block of the index data will be a block that wasn't flushed.\n\nHm, ok, honestly I ignored reorgs in my analysis because based on how frequently this seems to happen and I still would be surprised if it this is the (only) way this can occur. E.g. how many nodes crash right at the moment when a mainnet block was reorged but there was no flush yet? But I hope I can get more answers out of the logs when this happens again in the wild.",

The block filter and coinstats indexes store the block height and hash on disk (one as the db key, the other in the record value pair), which should be enough to tell how far the index got during init. We can reconstruct the index records’ sequence and drop, in reverse order, the ones that map to nonexistent blocks.\nFor the tx index no sequencing is needed, we can directly traverse the db and delete the records that map to nonexistent block files or block positions.",

Maybe in the future when we have made progress on a number of fronts. But here it goes: we could roll back the chain to the index fork point, calculate the muhash for the utxo set from scratch, compare the finalized out to the sha256 digest and then move on from there. Also, it would be possible that the blocks the index is on actually are in the main chain and so the index could also wait to see if they become available after all, also pretty messy though.\n\nEven though this doesn't seem realistic to me now this helps my argument on this:\n\n> Since the coinstatsindex is changing with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30469, maybe we should also add to that to store the full muhash for every block? This would be the best time to make such a breaking change.\n\nI tend to think we don't need to do this. For the issues that we are encountering there should be simpler fixes available like @mzumsande 's PR and the `MuHash3072` is essentially just a different representation of the UTXO set. We also don't persist the older versions of the UTXO set, we roll back the blocks if we need to get to an earlier state. So I would treat the `MuHash3072` the same way, as long as we have the necessary blocks we can roll back and forth. We just need to manage the data correctly which the fix PR should hopefully do. Also, the index would grow by >300MB by my back of the envelope calculation.",

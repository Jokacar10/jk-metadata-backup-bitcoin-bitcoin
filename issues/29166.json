    "title": "is a getBlockTemplate transactions's bug?",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nI invoke the getBlockTemplate interface using SegWit. The sum of weights in the returned transactions data is 3991625, and the sum of SigOps is 20037. Each time, I package all the transactions returned by getBlockTemplate into a block. I observe that the weight limit is 4000000, and the data returned complies with this requirement. However, I notice that the SigOp limit is 80000, and it is said that the sum of SigOps in transactions needs to be multiplied by 4, which in this case, 20037 * 4, exceeds 80000. I would like to know if mining a block in such a situation where SigOps exceed the limit will still be considered valid. Will it have any impact on the Coinbase reward and transaction fees?\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nIf this is indeed a bug, we hope for a prompt resolution.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nbitcoind25.0 mainnet\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n![bug](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/5387430/0645c2e3-7791-47c0-bf05-13d92ae7f7d5)\r\n\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv25.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nMacos 12.4\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "This is frustrating, but it seems to be how CMake works. `cmake --install build` doesn't force any builds, but `make -C build install` does.\n\nI think what you're really looking for is a way to only build/install certain binaries. For that, the workaround would be to name each one as a separate component. That would allow for:\n```cmake\ncmake -B build\ncmake --build build --target bitcoind bitcoin-cli\ncmake --install build --component bitcoind bitcoin-cli\n```",

    "title": "Consider making 27.x Long-Term Support (LTS)",
    "body": "As mentioned in the patch notes for 28.x, since this release drops support for glibc older than 2.31, it will not run on several widely used Linux distros, including RHEL 8 and the RHELatives that base off of this, such as AlmaLinux 8 and Rocky Linux 8.\r\n\r\nIn case anyone is unaware, RHEL 8 and its derivatives are still in active support, and will in fact not be EOL until 2029. While I don't have exact install numbers, I would not be surprised if more than half of Bitcoin Core installations that run on dedicated Linux servers will not be able to update to 28.x as a result of this, without first updating to a new OS.\r\n\r\nAs such, while I'm aware that older release branches usually have important updates backported for some time, I feel it would make sense to \"officially\" designate 27.x as a LTS with an extended window of backported updates - maybe not for the full four years and change until these OSes are EOL, but at least for a good part of it. Otherwise, considering the new security disclosure policy, I fear there will be a lot of clients with published exploits still running when 27.x advisories start getting published.",

This number doesn't feel right to me, even as a (high) estimate.\r\n\r\nThis report: https://repology.org/project/glibc/badges shows that glibc >=2.31 is supported by:\r\n\r\n- Debian 11, 12, 13\r\n- Fedora 32 - 40\r\n- Gentoo\r\n- Homebrew\r\n- Manjaro stable\r\n- nixpkgs\r\n- openSUSE > 15.3\r\n- Slackware current\r\n- Ubuntu >= 20.04\r\n\r\nWhilst it is a shame that RHEL 8 doesn't support it, it also doesn't feel practical for this project to support a LTS version for so long (and only for this distro) because of the nature of the patches that may require backport.\r\n\r\nFor example, whilst backporting critical security vulnerabilites *may* be practical in most cases, as these are often logic bugs or edge cases, backporting things like (potential) soft fork activation logic could prove to be much more work. And, unless someone volunteers to take this on, then, in my opinion, I don't think we have the resources to commit to that as a project.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, 27.x will be in maintenance support for [another ~12 months or so](https://bitcoincore.org/en/lifecycle/) already.\r\n\r\nI will leave my self open to being corrected on the usage metrics of RHEL 8 as a node OS, so in the case that there are, as you claim, a very large number of users using that OS, then I would happily reconsider my above opinion.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to find a volunteer who would commit to maintaining a seperate \"Long Term Support source tree\", providing LTS for RHEL 8. But with this approach you begin to lose some aspects of the security/review process which the mainline Bitcoin Core project brings to the table. \r\n",

Most of the distros mentioned here are not generally considered stable for production/server usage, and are only offered as unsupported custom installs. I rarely see free Linux distros except for AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, Ubuntu and Debian offered by default, and being the default, ~99% of servers will be deployed using it. While Ubuntu 18 and Debian 10 are now EOL, that still leaves RHEL and the derivatives.\r\n\r\nI don't have hard installation numbers between the four of course, but after Red Hat was eaten by IBM and CentOS 8 was gutted, I have mostly seen the server hosting industry defaulting to AlmaLinux 8 and Rocky Linux 8 in the last few years, and only fairly recently begun defaulting to AlmaLinux 9 and Rocky Linux 9. Considering that in-place upgrades from (RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux) 8 to 9 are not generally supported, I would expect the majority of servers and VPSes that were installed with any of the RHELatives to be running on the 8 branch for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n> However, I still don't understand why this is an issue.\r\n> Maybe I am missing something obvious, but at least locally I can call `./configure` on the `28.x` branch just fine on Alma8:\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure why glibc 2.28 support was dropped from the official binaries if it still trivially compiles against it.

So far, we have instead just had a single binary per hardware platform, compiled against modern glibc, but with specific workarounds to permit the binary to still support old glibc. It is a balancing question on how much work is warranted to test and maintain these workarounds.",

However, I haven't tried this and don't know how involved it would be.\r\n\r\nedit: However, someone may also complain that support for Ubuntu 18.04 was dropped.

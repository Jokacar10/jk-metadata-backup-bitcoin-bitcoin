    "body": "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nHello.\nPlease consider the possibility of creating a coin.\n\nIt will be minted at the time of purchase. And burned at the time of sale.\n\nWhich would be based on a liquidity pool in BTC and a defi contract.\n\nWhen buying and selling, you can charge a small commission. And send it to the liquidity pool.\n\nIf the sold number of coins is burned at the time of sale. Then the total price of the asset will never fall.\n\nSuch a model is already working successfully and has proven its effectiveness. In the project https://bpnmdefi.com\n\nBut unfortunately, the project is not very popular. Because of complex registration and confusing marketing.\n\nIf you make the purchase of such an asset easy. Then it will be successful. It will attract investors to bitcoin. Because they will see stability and guarantees.\n\nYou can make it in the image of bitcoin's older brother. In glasses and a square academic cap. While Bitcoin is having fun on the dance floor. (Volatility). The older brother runs the family business with a calculator in his hands. (Stable growth. Reliability. No scam.)\n\nI wish you success.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

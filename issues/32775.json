    "title": "Distinguish between vsize and sigop-adjusted mempool vsize",
    "body": "I was going through the up for grabs PR, and got interested in working on [this](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27591) but,  bitcoin locked and limited conversation to collaborators 2 weeks ago, so I couldn't comment directly there. \n\nBased on the previous discussions, here's my understanding of what needs to be done (if the change is still relavant) :\n\nKeep the existing vsize field as the sigop-adjusted size and the new vsize_bip141 field to clearly represent the BIP141 virtual size (non-sigop-adjusted)for mempool-related RPCs.\n\nAdd optional sigopsize (sigopsize = nSigOpCost * bytes_per_sigop, please correct me if am wrong)  getrawtransaction transaction when the transaction is in the mempool and the data is available.\n\nWrite additional documentation under doc/policy/ to explain the different vsize definitions, fee rates, and mining score heuristics.\n\nThanks!!!",

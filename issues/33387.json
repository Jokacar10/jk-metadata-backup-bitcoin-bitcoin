      "body": "Nice find, I think this probably is a real bug. I wouldn't expect it to happen normally because there is an `Ipc::disconnectIncoming()` call in `Shutdown()` to close all IPC connections before the chainman object is freed. However, the `disconnectIncoming()` implementation is only closing the IPC connections without waiting for the objects and threads associated with them to be freed. So if an IPC client makes a request and the node receives it, and the node starts to shut down before the request is executed, asserts like this could be triggered.\n\nA change like the following could fix the issue:\n\n```diff\n--- a/src/ipc/capnp/protocol.cpp\n+++ b/src/ipc/capnp/protocol.cpp\n@@ -75,9 +75,23 @@ public:\n         // Delete incoming connections, except the connection to a parent\n         // process (if there is one), since a parent process should be able to\n         // monitor and control this process, even during shutdown.\n+        int num_disconnected = 0;\n+        std::promise<void> promise;\n         m_loop->sync([&] {\n-            m_loop->m_incoming_connections.remove_if([this](mp::Connection& c) { return &c != m_parent_connection; });\n+            m_loop->m_incoming_connections.remove_if([&](mp::Connection& c) {\n+                if (&c != m_parent_connection) {\n+                    ++num_disconnected;\n+                    return true;\n+                }\n+                return false;\n+            });\n+            if (num_disconnected) m_loop->addAsyncCleanup([&] { promise.set_value(); } );\n         });\n+        if (num_disconnected) {\n+            LogDebug(BCLog::IPC, \"Disconnected %i IPC connections, starting cleanup...\", num_disconnected);\n+            promise.get_future().wait();\n+            LogDebug(BCLog::IPC, \"IPC connection cleanup complete.\");\n+        }\n     }\n     void addCleanup(std::type_index type, void* iface, std::function<void()> cleanup) override\n     {\n\n```\n\n\n",

    "title": "Avoid plural forms in non-GUI translatable strings (lacks `%n` support)",
    "body": "In non-GUI code, translatable strings with format specifiers rely on the `tinyformat::format` implementation, which does not support the `%n` specifier that is [crucial](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/i18n-plural-rules.html) for pluralising with Qt translation tools.\n\nTherefore, it may be worth considering rephrasing translatable strings to avoid potential plural forms.\n\nThis issue was initially reported on Transifex: https://app.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/translate/#fr/qt-translation-029x/570550303/.\n\nHere is an example of such a string: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/db36a92c02b83f2e6477a5a55fc061319f7cc6a3/src/init.cpp#L991",

      "body": "> Was there any followup here?\n\nBelow is the response I received:\n> Hi, Hennadii\n> \n> Here are some pluralization guidelines I wrote for one of my clients. Feel free to share them with the team:\n> \n> “Use proper plural forms\n> \n> Pluralization (p11n) is the process of changing nouns from the singular to the plural form. Not all languages change plural forms of nouns in the same way, some don’t have any plural form.\n> \n> There is a difference between plural forms and plural rules\n> \n> Plural forms are changes applied to a noun, an adjective or a verb when the word changes grammatical number. Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese don’t have any plurals, so there is one single form.\n> \n>    * German, Dutch, English, have two plural forms.\n> \n>    * French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish have three plural forms.\n> \n>    * Polish and Russian have four plural forms.\n> \n>    * Arabic has six plural forms.\n> \n> \n> Plural rules will tell you how to “get” the plural form. Sometimes it means adding a simple suffix like “s”, e.g., in English from “file” to “files”. In Russian, we would have: “”, “”, “”, and “”.\n> \n> Understanding CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository)\n> \n> The Unicode Consortium has created the CLDR project with the aim of tackling different plural forms and rules.\n> \n> Once the fixed part of the string is created, then the variable element (placeholder) is included. The CLDR presents a huge amount of data for many languages—including plural forms and rules.\n> \n> With CLDR, up to six different plural forms are categorized:\n> \n>    * zero\n> \n>    * one (singular)\n> \n>    * two (dual)\n> \n>    * few (paucal)\n> \n>    * many (also used for fractions if they have a separate class)\n> \n>    * other (required—general plural form—also used if the language only has a single form)\n> \n> \n> Transifex supports pluralized strings.\n> \n> In English, you may find it natural to use two strings to solve plurals: delete-cookie = Delete cookie delete-cookies = Delete cookies\n> \n> Transifex documentation states: Don’t use “1 character” and “# characters” in your code. Include the variable in all cases, i.e., use this: “# character” and “# characters”.\n> \n> Why? English uses two plural rules: “one” (“1 character”) and “other” (“0,2,10 characters”). But other languages bundle the different cases in other ways. For example, in Portuguese, it’s “0, 1 character” and “2, 10 characters”. So, when coding, ensure you always include the variable denoting the number of objects in the string.\n> \n> Transifex supports only one plural per pluralized strings. %1$d images and %1$d videos can’t be pushed as such.\n> \n> There are two solutions: Exceptionally create two separate strings and make one sentence out of the two:\n> \n>    1. %1$d images\n> \n>    2. and %1$d videos\n>        Create two separate strings and present them differently in the UI: %1$d images | %1$d videos\n> \n>    3. %1$d images\n> \n>    4. %1$d videos\n> \n>    5. The pipe is hardcoded here.”\n> \n> \n> For the case at hand, an easy solution is to create two pluralized strings:\n> \n> First pluralized string: Single form (one): Not enough file descriptors available. %d available.\n> \n> Plural form (other): Not enough file descriptors available. %d available.\n> \n> Second pluralized string: Single form (one): %d required.\n> \n> Plural form (other): %d required.\n> \n> You can then programmatically use both to make one sentence.\n> \n> We can see that the singular and plural forms are identical in English, as gender and plural agreement only exist for some languages. For such cases, the string dev notes need to clearly explain how the string is being used, with an example.\n> \n> On GitHub, someone mentions Qt. If Bitcoin Core is built with Qt, instead of using the XLIFF file type in Transifex, did you consider using the QT file format that Transifex offers and fully support? Would it make your life easier?\n> \n> Kind regards,\n> \n> _AO_ French language coordinator | Localization Lab [localizationlab.org](http://localizationlab.org/) | [transifex.com/organization/otf](http://transifex.com/organization/otf) 5C8F 0C0C 4812 7771 365C 262D 47DC 6187 47A9 22D2\n\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding about how we gather translatable string from the non-GUI code.",

This is fine, I guess, except its a bit confusing and easy to mis-implement in two-party protocols that wish to ensure the transactions they generate are standard. Is there a difference in v0 unknown-length inputs that merits them being nonstandard or should they simply be made standard?\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",

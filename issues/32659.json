    "title": "wallet: render BIP388 wallet policies",
    "body": "[BIP 388](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0388.mediawiki) wallet policies  were introduced by @bigspider to make it easier to verify descriptors on a signing device.\n\nA first step towards supporting them could be to add a `policy` and `keys` field to the `getdescriptorinfo` and `listdescriptors` RPC results. Only for the subset of descriptors that BIP388 allows.\n\nThese fields can be manually passed into HWI using this (somewhat old) PR https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/pull/647 as well as through other (?) tools.",

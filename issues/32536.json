      "body": "It sure is annoying when system packages are installed to a location where they cannot be found by default. On the other hand, package maintainers may have their reasons for doing that. There are probably multiple packages which depend on Qt6 and are built with CMake. It is very likely that package maintainers have their build environment set up for that.\n\nTrying to work around that \"issue\" creates a maintenance burden for us and potentially for package maintainers too, because our workaround may cause conflicts with their build environment setup. The most portable solution is to do - believe it or not - nothing at all.\n\nIf we want to provide binary packages for download on a website, we take the role of package maintainers. In packaging scripts, we need to setup a build environment so that all dependencies can be found. There are countless ways to do that. Two are mentioned above, other approaches are listed in the documentation of the [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) command. Such build scripts ideally should be maintained separate from the project, like in a separate repository.",

    "title": "Doc: Mempool Policy documentation Outdated since TRUC",
    "body": "Checking the [policy documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc/policy) I think I noticed that some things are outdated since Version 3 transaction relay / TRUC.\n\nSome sentences [like](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/policy/packages.md#package-fees-and-feerate): \n\n> Note: Package feerate cannot be used to meet the minimum relay feerate (-minrelaytxfee) requirement. For example, if the mempool minimum feerate is 5sat/vB and the minimum relay feerate is set to 5satvB, a 1sat/vB parent transaction with a high-feerate child will not be accepted, even if submitted as a package.\n\nAre no longer true. If I'm not wrong, in this specific case, you can now submit 0 feerate transactions and still be accepted.\n\nProbably there's more documentation outdated on this section worth to review.",

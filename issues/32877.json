    "title": "test: break `feature_block` into subtests?",
    "body": "According to [corecheck](https://corecheck.dev/tests), `feature_block` is the slowest functional test and it's taking about 70 seconds to run. `feature_block` is a huge functional test that tests many things - large re-orgs, block with invalid transactions, disabled opcodes, sigop counts, etc. These things are not necessary coupled and could be broken into subtests and then we could run some of them instead of the whole test (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30991) when necessary. \n\nThe motivation for it is our mutation testing analysis. `feature_block` is important on the analysis of some files but not the whole test. That said, spending 70 seconds on a single test per mutant is making our analysis to take a long time.",

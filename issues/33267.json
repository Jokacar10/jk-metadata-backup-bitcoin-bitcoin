    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nI'm on Bitcoin Core v29.0.0\n\nI noticed that when at the max number of peers (124 total; 10 outbound; 114 inbound) the most recent peer connection is continually dropped after 1 second and another peer is selected. I can't imagine this is good behavior for the network.\n\nAs you can see, my peer count is very high (basically == number of seconds I've been at 124 peers) and the most recent peer only ever has an age of 1s.\n\n<img width=\"968\" height=\"648\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb770a4b-a576-41e6-9d97-13c40fb13ca0\" />\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI would expect the program to stop accepting connections when peers == max_peers, instead of accepting the connection and dropping it 1 second later.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nLeave client running on a high speed network long enough to hit 124 peers.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv29.0.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nFreeBSD 14.3\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",

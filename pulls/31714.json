    "body": "`NeedsRedownload` exists to detect when a non-segwit client upgrades to segwit after segwit activation. In #21009, it was simplified from an upgrade algorithm to a simple check / recommendation to reindex.\r\n\r\nStill, iterating over hundred thousands of block indexes with each startup for this purpose doesn't seem necessary more than 7 years after segwit activation.\r\nThis PR suggests to only check the first segwit block instead. This is less thorough, but it will speed up init a little bit and the typical case of upgrading a non-segwit client that has already synced beyond the segwit height would still lead to an error.\r\nI also thought about removing `NeedsRedownload()` completely if reviewers prefer that alternative.",

Also, the block (if it was invalid) should normally be reorged out, once connected to the network?\r\n\r\nSo I wonder why keep the flag at all? If is is safe/acceptable to skip it for almost all heights, then it should also be safe to skip for this one specific remaining height?",

In this scenario we wouldn't fail anymore after this PR. However, I don't know if this ever would have worked (the pre-segwit client might have failed on startup, even with `-checkblocks=0`?), and even if so, this doesn't seem like a realistic scenario we need to accommodate.\r\n\r\nThe scenario that is still covered (someone upgrades from an old non-segwit client to a current version) seems much more realistic (even if that old client is EOL for ages, there might still be a few nodes out there according https://bitnodes.io/nodes/), and the check costs almost nothing after this PR, so I wasn't sure about complete removal.\r\n\r\n ",

What happens is that the node doesn't start - it tells me to reindex because `CCoinsViewDB::NeedsUpgrade()` is true - `DB_COINS` was deprecated in `v0.15.0` (1088b02f0ccd7358d2b7076bb9e122d59d502d02).\r\n\r\nSo, it seems to me that we'd need to reindex anyway for an unrelated reason when upgrading from any pre-`v0.15.0`  node to any post -`v0.15.0` node.

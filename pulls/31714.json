    "body": "`NeedsRedownload` exists to detect when a non-segwit client upgrades to segwit after segwit activation. In #21009, it was simplified from an upgrade algorithm to a simple check / recommendation to reindex.\r\n\r\nStill, iterating over hundred thousands of block indexes with each startup for this purpose doesn't seem necessary more than 7 years after segwit activation.\r\nThis PR suggests to only check the first segwit block instead. This is less thorough, but it will speed up init a little bit and the typical case of upgrading a non-segwit client that has already synced beyond the segwit height would still lead to an error.\r\nI also thought about removing `NeedsRedownload()` completely if reviewers prefer that alternative.",

Also, the block (if it was invalid) should normally be reorged out, once connected to the network?\r\n\r\nSo I wonder why keep the flag at all? If is is safe/acceptable to skip it for almost all heights, then it should also be safe to skip for this one specific remaining height?",

In this scenario we wouldn't fail anymore after this PR. However, I don't know if this ever would have worked (the pre-segwit client might have failed on startup, even with `-checkblocks=0`?), and even if so, this doesn't seem like a realistic scenario we need to accommodate.\r\n\r\nThe scenario that is still covered (someone upgrades from an old non-segwit client to a current version) seems much more realistic (even if that old client is EOL for ages, there might still be a few nodes out there according https://bitnodes.io/nodes/), and the check costs almost nothing after this PR, so I wasn't sure about complete removal.\r\n\r\n ",

What happens is that the node doesn't start - it tells me to reindex because `CCoinsViewDB::NeedsUpgrade()` is true - `DB_COINS` was deprecated in `v0.15.0` (1088b02f0ccd7358d2b7076bb9e122d59d502d02).\r\n\r\nSo, it seems to me that we'd need to reindex anyway for an unrelated reason when upgrading from any pre-`v0.15.0`  node to any post -`v0.15.0` node.

Saw no additional error.\r\n\r\nGood point, I saw that too in my run: `-reindex-chainstate` doesn't detect this with assumevalid being enabled so that script verification isn't done - only a full reindex will because this is checked in `AcceptBlock()` (`ContextualCheckBlock()`) at the time a block is saved to disk, but not in `ConnectBlock()`, which is called during reindex-chainstate. This is also explained in this code comment: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0a931a9787b196d7a620863cc143d9319ffd356d/src/validation.cpp#L2454-L2461\r\nI think that this is an argument for keeping a basic check ( as the current version of the PR does).\r\n\r\n> Shouldn't it be impossible for the tip block to have the flag, if the blocks between activation and the tip didn't also have it? So checking just the tip would be better and sufficient?\r\n\r\nBoth options - checking block 1 after segwit vs checking the tip should report an error if a user upgrades from a pre-segwit version to a current version - I can change it to that, but why is it \"better\" than checking the first block after activation?",

If there isn't one currently, then it might make sense (and be more conservative) to just add a comment to `NeedsRedownload()` so if/when there is one that the change could be made then. Although we are talking about seems like a very small number of (pre-segwit) nodes, so it might be nicer to make the change now and not have to revisit later.\r\n\r\nChecked performance with the blocks dir created in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31714#issuecomment-2616512394 (synced to block ~802000, with blocks before ~533000 missing `BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS`, so > 269k blocks checked from tip before the first block without `BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS` is encountered).  Node startup until error took 5 seconds on both 5c5f88b80ad783f66cd0fe314bf657e128ddfa80 and the commit before it, so a significant performance improvement wasn't observed (at least when checking backward from tip by 269k blocks). YMMV (different hardware,etc.). I'm curious if there would be a significant performance difference in a different environment (e.g. HDD).\r\n\r\nI do think the PR covers the \"common\" cases:\r\n- User is running a pre-segwit node that is up to date (i.e. synced past segwit activation). User upgrades to a modern release (pre this PR), which checks from tip backwards for missing BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS). Tip lacks BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS, so `NeedsRedownload()` returns true. Reindex is needed.\r\n- User is running a pre-segwit node that is up to date. User upgrades to a future release with this PR's change to check for BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS only at segwit activation. Same result (`NeedsRedownload()` returns true. Reindex is needed).\r\n- User is running a post-segwit node that is up to date. User upgrades to a future release with this PR's change. `NeedsRedownload()` returns false (faster).",

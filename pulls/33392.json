    "body": "Fixes [#28898](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28898)\r\nUsers who import descriptors with incorrect birthdates may encounter inaccurate wallet balances. In such cases, the wallet may miss historical transactions that belong to it, resulting in underreported balances.\r\nCurrently, the only way to correct this is to manually run rescanblockchain or reimport descriptors with proper metadata. However, users may not realize that their wallet balance is incomplete.\r\nThis PR introduces a mechanism for wallets to verify their trusted balance against the UTXO set. By rescanning the current UTXO set, the wallet can detect discrepancies and suggest corrective actions to the user.\r\n\r\n**Features**\r\nAdds a scan_utxoset argument to both getbalance and getbalances RPCs.\r\nWhen enabled:\r\nThe wallet collects all scriptPubKeys from its descriptors.\r\nThe node scans the chainstate UTXO set for matching outputs.\r\nA scanned balance is calculated independently of the wallet’s transaction history.\r\n\r\nIf the scanned balance differs from the wallet’s trusted balance:\r\nThe result includes a utxo_discrepancy object with both balances and a suggested action.\r\nUsers are advised to run rescanblockchain or reimport descriptors with correct birthdates.\r\n\r\n**Example usage**\r\nNormal trusted balance\r\n`$ bitcoin-cli getbalance\r\n0.01000000\r\n`\r\n\r\nWith UTXO set scan\r\n```\r\n$ bitcoin-cli getbalance \"* 0 false false true\"\r\n{\r\n  \"amount\": 0.01000000,\r\n  \"scanned_amount\": 0.01500000,\r\n  \"warnings\": \"Scanned UTXO balance (0.01500000 BTC) is larger than the wallet's trusted balance (0.01000000 BTC). If this is unexpected, consider running rescanblockchain or reimporting descriptors with correct birthdates to restore missing transaction history.\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n$ bitcoin-cli getbalances true\r\n{\r\n  \"mine\": {\r\n    \"trusted\": 0.01000000,\r\n    \"untrusted_pending\": 0.00000000,\r\n    \"immature\": 0.00000000\r\n  },\r\n  \"utxo_scanned_balance\": 0.01500000,\r\n  \"utxo_discrepancy\": {\r\n    \"wallet_trusted_balance\": 0.01000000,\r\n    \"utxo_scanned_balance\": 0.01500000,\r\n    \"suggested_action\": \"If this is unexpected, consider running rescanblockchain or reimporting descriptors with correct birthdates to restore missing transaction history.\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"lastprocessedblock\": {\r\n    \"height\": 900000,\r\n    \"hash\": \"000000000000000...\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Implementation Notes**\r\nIntroduces `FindCoinsByScript` to scan the chainstate UTXO set for a set of scripts.\r\n`ScanWalletUTXOSet` aggregates spendable/watched outputs and tallies balances.\r\nResults are merged into existing getbalance / getbalances RPCs behind a new scan_utxoset flag.\r\nCoinbase maturity rules are applied consistently.\r\n\r\n**Review Notes**\r\nThis does not replace rescanblockchain; it only provides a diagnostic check.\r\nFor large wallets, UTXO scans may be expensive but should complete faster than a full rescan.\r\nMaintains backwards compatibility by defaulting scan_utxoset=false.\r\nAdds optional result fields only when scan_utxoset is enabled.\r\n",

      "body": "It seems kind of weird to me to add this as an option to `getbalance`. The problem is in the `importdescriptors` call, which is using the wrong birthdate. Have you looked into making this an option of `importdescriptors`? If the performance isn't too bad, this could even be on by default. If that is possible that would seem preferred, since you also write \"However, users may not realize that their wallet balance is incomplete.\", if they don't know they likely also won't call the `getbalance` with this option. So ideally we could \"force\" this on users in a way that they don't feel (much) negative impact from it. If we can't do that then I am not sure this is of much use since the users could just call `rescanblockchain` directly if they are aware that there is a problem with their balances.",

So instead of a full rescan from the start of the chain the rescan could move backwards from the originally supplied birth date and scan the chain in 1000 (or so) block increments and it could stop once the balance matches the one from the utxo set scan. A nice side effect of this is that it means the rescan is also pruning compatible (for as many blocks that are available) but I guess this could be also achieved by starting from pruneheight instead of 0 if pruning is enabled. It's something you need to keep in mind either way. This would also need benchmarks but I can't imagine moving backwards with somewhat large increments would make the process much slower.

      "body": "> Just to make sure we’re on the same page — my understanding is that the idea is to:\r\n> \r\n> Use chunked backward rescans starting from the supplied birthdate (e.g. 1000-block increments), and stop as soon as the wallet balance matches the UTXO-set scan. This handles the common case where the birthdate is only off by a few days or weeks, so we don’t need to rescan the entire chain.\r\n\r\nRight, so for example if the supplied birthdate was blockheight `800,000` but there is a discrepancy, then, instead rescanning from 0 to 800k right away, scan 799k - 800k and check the balance, exit if it's a match, continue with 798k - 799k and so on. This shouldn't be too complex to implement since the `rescanblockchain` RPC already takes a start and an end height.\r\n\r\n> At the same time, respect the pruneheight as the lower bound if pruning is enabled. That means we only scan back as far as blocks are available, and if the discrepancy still isn’t resolved at that point, we’d warn the user that a reindex is required.\r\n\r\nYeah, there would be some kind of safe abort if the approach for walking backwards runs into unavailable blocks, just like `rescanblockchain` does as well.",

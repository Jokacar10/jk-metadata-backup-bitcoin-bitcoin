The difference will be seen when number is increased to actual numbers ? ~I am of the view that benchmarks be close to the actual numbers and would probably like some actual input numbers to be put rather than the small dummy numbers since these aren't the markers for this benchmark.~\r\n\r\nEDIT: After examining the code again , I see that 1000 transactions are taken . Although still far from real world scenario (with 5 inputs/output) . Should be okay for a benchmark .",

Given that, as I understand, part of the motivation for this benchmark's introduction (#31689) is to be able to compare `ConnectBlock()` performance with and without schnorr batch validation (#29491), and part of the motivation for using Schnorr signatures in the first place is that they're susceptible to batch validation, it seems to me that it would be useful for these three benchmarks to be as like as possible, so that they can be compared, and this PR makes that the case in my testing.\r\n\r\nRecent PR review club where this was discussed: (https://bitcoincore.reviews/31689#l-60). \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\n\r\n## Benchmark Results \r\n\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n### master (c66f7dab33fb08dc323)\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git checkout --detach 924f25f~1\r\n$ cmake -B build -DBUILD_BENCH=ON && cmake --build build -j $(nproc)\r\n$ ./build/bin/bench_bitcoin --filter=ConnectBlock.* --min-time=5000\r\n```\r\n\r\n|            ns/block |             block/s |    err% |       ins/block |       cyc/block |    IPC |      bra/block |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|----------------:|-------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       46,549,571.00 |               21.48 |    1.2% |  672,393,930.64 |  161,287,432.73 |  4.169 |  15,122,140.18 |    1.7% |      5.46 | `ConnectBlockAllEcdsa`\r\n|       47,199,469.60 |               21.19 |    0.2% |  680,249,499.27 |  164,132,414.09 |  4.145 |  15,120,173.64 |    1.7% |      5.47 | `ConnectBlockAllSchnorr`\r\n|       59,705,754.22 |               16.75 |    0.7% |  839,091,363.50 |  207,657,368.33 |  4.041 |  18,945,901.12 |    1.8% |      5.55 | `ConnectBlockMixedEcdsaSchnorr`\r\n\r\n### pr branch (924f25f6fc766cb)\r\n\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git checkout --detach 924f25f\r\n$ cmake -B build -DBUILD_BENCH=ON && cmake --build build -j $(nproc)\r\n$ ./build/bin/bench_bitcoin --filter=ConnectBlock.* --min-time=5000\r\n```\r\n\r\n|            ns/block |             block/s |    err% |       ins/block |       cyc/block |    IPC |      bra/block |   miss% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------------:|----------------:|-------:|---------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       58,425,229.87 |               17.12 |    0.6% |  840,316,339.12 |  203,096,705.00 |  4.138 |  18,694,845.12 |    1.7% |      5.45 | `ConnectBlockAllEcdsa`\r\n|       59,756,200.89 |               16.73 |    0.6% |  846,439,909.12 |  207,679,122.78 |  4.076 |  18,670,295.75 |    1.8% |      5.52 | `ConnectBlockAllSchnorr`\r\n|       59,767,476.56 |               16.73 |    0.6% |  840,513,726.44 |  207,604,950.00 |  4.049 |  18,968,510.88 |    1.8% |      5.58 | `ConnectBlockMixedEcdsaSchnorr`\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n> My output is less verbose compared to the outputs by other reviewers for some reason.\r\n\r\nThis is because nanobench provides some extra stats via linux's `perf_events` subsystem and omits them when they're not available:\r\n\r\n> CPU statistics like instructions, cycles, branches, branch misses are only available on Linux, through [perf events](http://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/perf_events/).

Very cool to see this coming from the PR review club. While not strictly necessary for all of these benchmarks to have the same number of transactions, I think this change better aligns with the motivation of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31689 and will help avoid confusion in the future. Also agree that the variable rename improves the readability. ",

      "body": "Hey @l0rinc ,\r\n\r\nI appreciate you reiterating this feedback! I actually tend to agree with you, however do not quite agree with the strategy laid out in your suggested changes, and my lack of experience makes me hesitant to make any sweeping changes.\r\n\r\nFor your suggested changes, in order for the metric to be tx/s I believe the batch size would actually need to be the number of txs and not the outputs.size(). Additionally, I actually think the metric we would really want is tx outputs/s, as switching to tx/s wouldn't actually resolve the issue this pr focused on. From a technical perspective it would be inaccurate to say that this benchmark is actually measuring tx outputs/s just by scaling the batch because what it actually would bench is just connectblock divided by the number of tx outputs which doesn't change the metric in a meaningful way.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, for a \"ConnectBlock\" benchmark my assumption is that this could potentially be used to benchmark other aspects of connectblock functionality, not just signature validation, in which case tx outputs/s would not really be an appropriate metric. I do think it might be valuable to have a separate benchmark that is more focused at the tx output granularity level.\r\n\r\n> I think it would clarify things if we defined more precisely what we're measuring.\r\n\r\nIn my view, block/s is the most precise definition of what we're measuring and tx/s (or tx output/x) would be an obfuscation.",

      "body": "> In my view, block/s is the most precise definition of what we're measuring and tx/s (or tx output/x) would be an obfuscation.\r\n\r\nIsn't the point of this PR to change what blocks/s means? That's why this PR exists, since a block doesn't really narrow down what we're measuring. We might as well call it `thing/s`.\r\n\r\n> the metric we would really want is tx outputs/s\r\n\r\nI think that's basically what I wrote (you can scale it to actual transaction outputs, but since the transaction count is the same for all, it's just a multiplier, won't change the ratios)\r\n\r\nWe can also write:\r\n```C++\r\nbench.batch(test_block.vtx.size() * outputs.size()).unit(\"txo\").run([&] {\r\n```\r\nor even\r\n```C++\r\nbench.batch(std::accumulate(test_block.vtx.begin(), test_block.vtx.end(), size_t{0}, [](size_t sum, const auto& tx) { return sum + tx->vout.size(); })).unit(\"txo\").run([&] {\r\n```\r\nif you think that's more accurate, but calling it \"block/s\" and than changing the value and still calling it \"block/s\" is not the sign of a reliable benchmark.\r\n\r\nWill let you decide, I basically already said these in the other PR as well.",

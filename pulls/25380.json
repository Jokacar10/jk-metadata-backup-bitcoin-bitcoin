    "body": "The fee estimator currently considers the fee of a transaction in isolation (and doesn't consider transactions with unconfirmed parents). This could hold well when it was just a few outliers. But as CPFP is becoming common practice whether it is among wallets (#23074 has a few instances) or protocols (for instance the LN with anchor outputs), i'm afraid that if fees rise this can lead to significantly *underestimated* results.\r\nSee the first commit's message for details and #23074 for history.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a much simpler alternative to #23074. The point is to fix the issue before we come up with a reasonable way to track package feerates in the fee estimator.\r\n\r\nThe functional test is in a separate commit so reviewers can more easily cherry-pick it on master and see the fee estimator would return the wrong estimate.",

As far as i can tell from discussions and the algorithm it's always been the opinion to err on the conservative side.\r\n\r\n> It's probably bad to include both sponsors and sponsees in CPFP situations?\r\n\r\nSponsees aren't included since transactions with mempool dependencies don't get considered for fee estimation. And i don't think we can do that until we find a proper way of considering packages in the fee estimator.",

      "body": "Thanks everyone for the interest, finally reviving this. Rebased and modernized the code (use static casts and named parameters, make use of batched RPC calls after #26656).\r\n\r\n@naumenkogs\r\n>  If we really want to check, we can measure how would fees differ by applying this change to historic blocks (?)\r\n\r\nWe'd also need historical snapshots of a mempool to do that. If someone has got some and is willing to test, i'd be very interested in seeing the results.\r\n\r\n> Otherwise, it would help if @darosior summarized the alternatives suggested in couple sentences (or helping in navigating the design scope e.g. \"what could be possibly done\").\r\n\r\nThe design space is actually quite narrow. Short of tracking packages, we can only get rid of invalid data points. I aim for the detection logic to be straightforward and conservative: better let a few invalid data points still go through rather than drop some valid ones.\r\nTo achieve this we go through the mempool entries that were included in a block when connecting it. We then apply two heuristics to determine whether it is a child paying for a parent we may be tracking for fee estimation:\r\n1. The individual feerate of this transaction is higher than its ancestor feerate. (Will be equal if it has no ancestor.)\r\n2. The individual feerate of the parent is lower than the individual feerate of this transaction. (Note it is not necessary to check if the parent itself has ancestors since if it does we wouldn't be tracking it for fee estimation.)\r\n\r\nIt was suggested by @mzumsande in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25380#discussion_r920292164 we may be able to get rid of the first heuristic, effectively only checking if a transaction we are tracking was mined along with a child transaction that has a higher feerate. I don't think it is correct, as the child transaction's effective feerate may be lower than the parent's. For instance:\r\n```\r\nA (1000sats; 100vb)\r\n                    \\\r\n                      C (1200sats; 100vb)\r\n                    /\r\nB (100sats; 100vb)\r\n```\r\nIn this diagram, `C` would be incorrectly accounted as a CPFP of `A` if we were to only use the second heuristic. However by using both heuristics `C` would still be detected as a CPFP of `B` (and only of `B`).\r\n\r\nAnother thing that could be done here is to take into account \"second-order\" CPFP. That is, if the child of the child of a transaction we are tracking for fee estimation is bumping. For instance (same as above + `D`):\r\n```\r\nA (1000sats; 100vb)\r\n                    \\\r\n                      C (1200sats; 100vb) -- D (10000sats; 100vb)\r\n                    /\r\nB (100sats; 100vb)\r\n```\r\nIn this diagram we would not be detecting neither `A` nor `B` as being CPFP'd. But solving this requires looking at the descendant feerate of an entry, which AFAICT brings a lot of complexity (and computation) to make sure we don't count a descendant multiple times in more complicated packages. In addition i suspect most CPFPs used on the network currently are \"first-order\" CPFPs (e.g. an \"accelerate\" button on a deposit on an onchain wallet, or anchor outputs for commitment transactions in Lightning).\r\nTherefore, even if it was reasonable to try to account for longer chains of CPFPs (which i'm not convinced it is), i'd be more inclined to not attempts to do so here. If we want to do this let's merge this simple and straightforward fix for most of the CPFP usage and try to tackle edge cases in a follow-up.\r\n\r\nFinally, i'm considering being more strict on the first heuristic. We could for instance require that the child is at least a 10% increase in feerate to be considered a CPFP. Because currently a parent would be considered to have been CPFP'd if it has a child with an individual feerate `0.001sat/vb` higher than its ancestor feerate. In this case i think the parent's feerate is still a good datapoint and we shouldn't get rid of it. What do you all think?",

For instance, upon confirmation of a\npackage {A, B} where A is 1sat/vb and B 20sat/vb, the fee estimator\nwould assume that 1sat/vb was sufficient for getting this transaction\nconfirmed.\n\nThis can lead to significantly underestimated fees as CPFP gets more\nusage on the network. It is currently actively used by many wallets, and\nwill get more adoption along with L2s that rely on it for fee bumping\n(for instance the Lightning Network with anchor outputs).\n\nI previously attempted a boutique accounting of child feerates [0], but a\ndecent tracking of ancestor scores as new child come in and parts of\npackages get confirmed will require significantly more work.

      "message": "policy/fees: ignore transactions that were CPFP'd\n\nThe fee estimator would previously assume that a miner was only\nincentivized by the fees of a transaction in isolation, completely\ndisregarding its descendants. For instance, upon confirmation of a\npackage {A, B} where A is 1sat/vb and B 20sat/vb, the fee estimator\nwould assume that 1sat/vb was sufficient for getting this transaction\nconfirmed.\n\nThis can lead to significantly underestimated fees as CPFP gets more\nusage on the network. It is currently actively used by many wallets, and\nwill get more adoption along with L2s that rely on it for fee bumping\n(for instance the Lightning Network with anchor outputs).\n\nI previously attempted a boutique accounting of child feerates [0], but a\ndecent tracking of ancestor scores as new child come in and parts of\npackages get confirmed will require significantly more work. In the\nmeantime just detect transactions that were likely confirmed because of\ntheir descendants' feerate and don't take them into account for fee\nestimation.

      "body": "> This PR is trying to ensure that the ancestors of a transaction that is assumed to be CPFP should not be recorded in the fee estimator statistics as confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this PR is to prevent a transaction tracked in the fee estimator to be assumed as being mined thanks to solely its own feerate when it's not. Technically it's equivalent to what you describe.\r\n\r\n> If CPFP adoption continues to increase, the data that `CBlockPolicyEstimator` will have for fee estimation will be reduced drastically, which might potentially result in the fee estimator giving us a high fee estimate or some unexpected fee rate, because we don't have the right amount of data.\r\n\r\nThe fee estimator would fail if it doesn't have enough data points to give a reasonable estimation. Unfortunately right now in the situation you describe it would return an incorrectly low estimate instead for the reason mentioned above.\r\n\r\n> If we want to further improve fee estimation e.g. opting into the approach in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23074#pullrequestreview-764375424\r\n\r\nI'm skeptical we could improve the fee estimator to consider packages without a significant rewrite. The current algorithm tracks the time between arrival in our mempool and inclusion in a block. With a package you don't have a single arrival time anymore. And it's unclear how a replacement of part of the package would affect our estimates.\r\n\r\nHere is an example. A 4-txs package with a 10sats/vb feerate arrives at block height `n`. At block height `n+2` we get a fifth transaction, bumping the feerate to 12sats/vb. At `n+8` 3 of the transactions get replaced, the package feerate is bumped to 14sats/vb and included at block `n+9`. It's not clear how we would analyze this situation in the current framework.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly an argument for restricting ourselves to certain kinds of packages, or to packages that are relayed once (assuming package relay otherwise it's still more complex) and never change. This way we could adapt our fee estimation framework to what's being used on the network and maybe adapt it as usage patterns change.\r\n\r\nTo be fair this seems to me closer to a research project than something we could implement anytime soon, but maybe i'm overly pessimistic.",

It could just mean that this transaction had high-feerate ancestors.\r\n\r\nSuggested alternative: I think `ancestor_score < individual_feerate` would be a good indication that this tx was the sponsor of a CPFP in the block. Maybe we use that condition, and drop all of the transaction's ancestors from the fee estimator?  Or, to reduce over-pruning, we drop the ancestors whose feerates are lower than this transaction's?",

      "body": "(TL;DR your suggestion is best but i'm leaving the response to the first section for context)\r\n\r\nYeah it's a best effort. I could make sure that the descendant was also part of the block. Is it worth it though? If an ancestor-less transaction with mempool child that pay a higher feerate than itself got mined, the child probably got included as well (not necessarily, but i assumed very probably).\r\nDo you think that assumption isn't reasonable? My doubt is more with more convoluted packages. For instance:\r\n```\r\nA ------ D\r\n      __/ /\r\nB /      /\r\n      _ /\r\nC /\r\n```\r\nWith `A` 1sat/vb, `B` 10sat/vb, `C` 10sat/vb and `D` 1sat/vb. It would be a false positive for `A`. To prevent this we could simply condition the check on the descendants feerate of `A`:\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/src/policy/fees.cpp b/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\nindex 029dd108c3..5d5dfb2efe 100644\r\n--- a/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\n@@ -609,9 +609,12 @@ bool CBlockPolicyEstimator::processBlockTx(unsigned int nBlockHeight, const CTxM\r\n     // Note this check is only best-effort, as the child might not be part of the block.

I agree it's much better. It makes sure that the child was part of the same block. And your suggestion to only drop the ancestors whose feerates are lower than this transaction's covers the case i detailed above. Nice! Is that roughly what you were thinking about:\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/src/policy/fees.cpp b/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\nindex 029dd108c3..8c0e71ea18 100644\r\n--- a/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/policy/fees.cpp\r\n@@ -604,16 +604,6 @@ bool CBlockPolicyEstimator::processBlockTx(unsigned int nBlockHeight, const CTxM\r\n         return false;\r\n     }\r\n \r\n-    // Do not consider this transaction's feerate if it might have been mined due to one of\r\n-    // its children (CPFP).\r\n-    // Note this check is only best-effort, as the child might not be part of the block.

Instead, i think any more complexity than a simple conservative heuristic should go into making the estimator packages-aware.\r\n\r\nRegarding the documentation of the heuristic, what are you suggesting?

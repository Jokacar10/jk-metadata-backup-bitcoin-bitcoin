      "body": "> Wait, how does pausing IDB help with benchmarking IBD?\r\n\r\nI had a chat with @Sjors recently regarding a benchmarking use case I have, where I want to benchmark doing IBD on more recent blocks to test flush behaviour. AssumeUTXO seemed useful here in that I can start from, e.g., 800,000 and sync to tip. For this, background validation would likely interfere with the results so having a `-pausebackgroundvalidation` option seemed useful. Worth mentioning, this is not meant to be a representative benchmark, but rather a way to iterate quickly and see how different DB configurations would have an effect on representative data.\r\n\r\n> Is there a strong use case for this?\r\n\r\nFor my use case, all I need is a patch to cherry-pick onto my branches. @Sjors mentioned he had other reasons that this might be _generally_ useful for AssumeUTXO users, hence the PR. Assuming my benchmarking idea works, I could see this being a generally useful option, e.g., for running a regression test where we benchmark IBD performance from 50k blocks back to chaintip nightly (or something like that), so I don't think adding it as an option is a negative. Alternatively, my suggestion for the regression testing / benchmarking use case would be to make it a compile time flag. I haven't checked if we have a notion of \"hidden options\" (similar to how we have hidden RPCs), but if there is a strong case for making it a runtime flag, I'd suggest hiding it since the use case I envision is more for testing / debugging and not general use.",

Worsening the code for test-only purposes is something I think we should only do if the alternatives are too much of a hassle.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I don't see a proper use case for end users either. I think the discussion to allow the user to skip background validation entirely (or, have it be a separate process using kernel, allowing the user to (re-)run it whenever they want) I think is valid, but `-pausebackgroundsync` seems like the wrong way to go to me, so I'm Concept NACK.",

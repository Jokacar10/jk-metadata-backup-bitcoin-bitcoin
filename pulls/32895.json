    "body": "When a wallet is automatically upgraded, we always do so in a way that allows the user to load their wallet in an older version. When the user loads their wallet into an upgraded version again, the wallet may not perform the automatic upgrade and end up with upgraded and non-upgraded material in the wallet.\r\n\r\nIf we write the version of the last client to open the wallet, we would be able to detect these upgrade-downgrade-upgrade situations and perform another upgrade if so. However, in order for this to work, we need to have implemented writing the last client version into versions prior to the ones which introduce new automatic upgrades.\r\n\r\nWe are already writing the last client version into all wallets in a \"version\" record, although this record is not updated in the same way across all previous versions. Since v24.0, we are always updating the record when the client version differs, but prior to that, the record would only be updated when the client version is newer. Even so, we can use this record to store the last client version. This PR only moves that record to the end of `LoadWallet`, after the automatic upgrades, so that it will only be written after upgrades are performed, and not before. This guarantees that if an upgrade is interrupted, it will be done again on the next load.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some upgrades may require access to private keys, which is not possible for encrypted wallets. Since a wallet may be loaded into different versions without being decrypted in any of them and therefore not receive any upgrades, this PR adds a new field to record the version of the last client to decrypt the wallet. This is written after a wallet is unlocked and after upgrades are performed.",

I know that running from the master branch is not supported and devs will have to deal with un-upgraded material themselves, but it seems easy to fix (and cleaner) to just introduce a new variable in the wallet that is equal to the current `CLIENT_VERSION` and then handle it separately and explicitly from now on.",

      "body": "Concept ACK. It shouldn't hurt to add more metadata to help detect when there might be a mix of old data in a newer format and new data in an older format in the same wallet.\r\n\r\nConceptually, I think we could always detect these cases by just scanning the entire wallet for data that needs to be upgraded on loading. But having this extra metadata is nice because it can avoid slowing down wallet loading by avoiding unnecessary upgrade rescans.\r\n\r\nOn the approach in e94ef51837daa5ec9552eb14e8ccc38d1b82b65b, I think it is ok, but would suggest some ways it might be improved:\r\n\r\n- I agree with Marco's [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32895#issuecomment-3048078577) that it would be great to move away from CLIENT_VERSION and use something independent of the node version.\r\n  - A downside of this suggestion is that the PR might not be able to reuse the existing VERSION field and might need to introduce 2 new fields instead of 1. I think the tradeoff could be worth it though.\r\n- It would be nice to avoid version numbers altogether and use feature flags instead, defining new feature flags when new data fields are introduced, and writing supported feature flags to LAST_OPENED_FEATURES & LAST_DECRYPTED_FEATURES fields on wallet loading.\r\n  - This would not require introducing a new data type since we already have a [WalletFlags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/927055e42afbfd998b5d85108e9c5fe7c6ffb7aa/src/wallet/walletutil.h#L36-L78) enum. New internal and external features could just be new (nonmandatory) `WalletFlags` values.\r\n  - IMO, flags are better than version numbers because they decouple code that implements new features from the merge and release process. They also make code more readable and maintainable because checks like `if (last_opened_supported_specific_feature_x)` are more obvious than `if (last_opened_version > some_version_number_with_collection_of_features)`\r\n- I assume we don't care about detecting upgrades & downgrades to versions before v24.0 which wouldn't overwrite the `VERSION` field on opening. But if we did, it'd be possible to detect this by writing last_opened and last_decrypted metadata to a file alongside the wallet database instead of inside the wallet database, and touching the file whenever the database is flushed. This way, if the database file modification time was greater than metadata file modification time, you could infer that the database had been loaded by an older version in the meantime and needs to be upgraded. Wouldn't recommend this approach because it is more complicated, but wanted to mention it as an alternative to introducing new database fields.",

The detection only works because of older versions overwriting the field with their CLIENT_VERSION. Introducing a new field now means that we cannot detect when an upgraded wallet was opened in any version older than v30.0 (assuming this is merged for the next release). The timeline would be too soon for any newly introduced features in say v31.0 or v32.0 (and I've got a few things in mind already that would utilize this). I'm already not particularly thrilled by the fact that the current implementation can only detect down to 24.0 as I expect that users doing upgrade-downgrade-upgrade with even older versions is commonplace.\r\n\r\n> Conceptually, I think we could always detect these cases by just scanning the entire wallet for data that needs to be upgraded on loading.\r\n\r\nI don't think that is actually viable as it would largely end up performing the upgrade on all loads regardless of whether the upgrade has already been done.",

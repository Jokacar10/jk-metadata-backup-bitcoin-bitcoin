    "body": "Opening this PR mostly to get concept/approach feedback.\r\n\r\nThis is motivated by the kernel library, where the internal usage of leveldb is a limiting factor to its future use cases. Specifically it is not possible to share leveldb databases between two processes. A notable use-case for the kernel library is accessing and analyzing existing block data. Currently this can only be done by first shutting down the node writing this data. Moving away from leveldb opens the door towards doing this in parallel. A flat file based approach was chosen, since the requirements for persistence here are fairly simple (no deletion, constant-size entries). The change also offers better performance by making node startup faster, and has a smaller on-disk footprint, though this is negligible in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nThe BlockTreeStore introduces a new data format for storing block indexes and headers on disk. The class is very similar to the existing CBlockTreeDB, which stores the same data in a leveldb database. Unlike CBlockTreeDB, the data stored through the BlockTreeStore is directly serialized and written to flat .dat files. The storage schema introduced\r\nis simple. It relies on the assumption that no entry is ever deleted and that no duplicate entries are written. These assumptions hold for the current users of CBlockTreeDB.\r\n\r\nA write ahead ahead log and boolean flags as file existence checks ensure write atomicity. Every data entry is also given a crc32c checksum to detect data corruption.\r\n\r\nThe change also opens the door towards getting rid of having to reindex the block tree due to corruption (though switching from pruned -> un-pruned still requires extra logic). This would simplify a lot of kernel/validation code, as can be seen in this [commit](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commit/bfb2709e1d116d4e613601c3f0140f099530159d#diff-28f178018e05634ee3f8ddce3f4e0cec334ae69915cecf92be8299c749d8d470). The implementation here should be fairly robust against corruption (no parallel read/writes, no background compaction).\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this pull request, that could allow the same kernel feature, would be closing and opening the leveldb database only when reading and writing. This might incur a (negligible) performance penalty, but more importantly requires careful consideration of how to handle any contentions when opening, which might have complex side effects due to our current locking mode. It would also be possible to introduce an existing database with the required features for just the block tree, but that would introduce reliance on a new dependency and come with its own tradeoffs. For these reasons I chose this approach.",

      "body": "Thanks @TheCharlatan for this proposal and making the code changes.!\r\n\r\nPlease find my review comments, suggestions and some clarifying questions:\r\n\r\n1) How will concurrent reads (and potentially writes) be handled with the flat file format?\r\n\r\n2) Even if no deletion occurs, file corruption or partial writes can happen. Are you planning mmap or memory buffering?\r\n\r\n3) What would be the \"Corruption Recovery Strategy?\" -- While the write-ahead log is mentioned as future work, providing even a minimal rollback/recovery mechanism in the initial version would make this stronger.\r\n\r\n4) What would be the \"**Migration Path**\"? -- Will there be tooling or a migration process from existing leveldb-based data\r\n\r\n5) Data Integrity Guarantees? -- Are checksums or hash-based verifications being added per entry or per file?\r\n\r\n6) Consider including a pluggable interface that allows fallback to LevelDB for testing or backwards compatibility\r\n\r\n7) **Write contention and corruption risks:** -- While flat files avoid LevelDB’s process-level locking, concurrent writes require a mechanism (e.g., file locks, flock()) to prevent race conditions.\r\n8) **Portability and Cross platform related edge cases:** -- Ensure file-locking mechanisms (e.g., fcntl on Unix, LockFileEx on Windows) are robust.\r\n\r\n9) How about Handling Large Files? -- Test edge cases like file sizes approaching OS limits (e.g., 2+ GB on 32-bit systems). What would happen in such cases?\r\n\r\n10) On similar lines to point-5 -- **Corruption Detection** mechanism could also be implemented to detect corruptions very early in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThe flat-file approach is a reasonable trade-off given the simplicity of the block tree storage requirements. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are major significant challenges and risks involved with this approach as highlighted in the above 10 comments.

Waiting for Bitcoin Core to finish IBD\r\n2. Reading all of the blocks out over JSON-RPC\r\n3. Parsing them and writing them into the appropriate indexes\r\n\r\nI started on a PoC for Electrs to use libbitcoinkernel for index building to demonstrate how this could be done much more efficiently and saw promising results. However, the requirement that Bitcoin Core be shut down before Electrs could process the block files made this approach clunky. I'll revive this PoC as a means of testing this PR and hopefully provide some use case motivated feedback on the approach.",

Are you suggesting we create ~900k files and then have some subdivision within those files into 10k groups where each of those has a single `$HASH.dat` with all the headers and file pointers for the blocks in that division? Is there something we gain through that? My impression is we do the file splitting in the first place to make pruning easier. We don't prune headers, so I don't think splitting the file gains us anything. I don't think there is much wrong with just having a single file. Maybe it even helps the OS a bit to manage the file buffers?",

      "body": "How worried are we about file corruption here? I thought the main reason we use leveldb and sqlite databases in places like this where we don't need indexing is that they support atomic updates, so you can pull the power cord any time and next time you reboot you will will see some consistent view of the data, even if it's not the latest data. I didn't look too closely at the implementation here but it seems like it is updating data in the files in place, so if writes are interrupted, data could be corrupt, and it's not clear if there are even checksums in place that would detect this.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is not an issue for the PR, but it would be good to make clear what types of corruption BlockTreeStore can and can't detect and what types of corruption it can recover from. If it can do simple things to detect corruption like adding checksums, or to prevent it like writing to temporary files and renaming them in place, those could be good to consider.\r\n\r\nIf this PR does introduce some increased risk of corruption, maybe that is worth it for reasons listed in the description. I also think another alternative could be to use sqlite for this since this would not necessarily introduce a new dependency and we already have a [ReadKey/WriteKey/EraseKey/HasKey](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6d5edfcc585bab3374ae14aa7918b3e178e016aa/src/wallet/sqlite.h#L76-L80) wrapper functions for sqlite that might help it be an easy replacement for leveldb.",

I would imagine that would create I/O problems, since the operating system wouldn't know which part of the big file changed. And it can't defragment it.\r\n\r\nYes, that is what I meant. We never change block files, so that is not a problem. I'm also not sure how real this problem actually is. A bunch of databases just maintain one big file and have good performance doing so. I'm still not sure what the benefit of what you propose would be. Either way, I think this is a bit out of scope, since while this change implements a database migration, it does not require a reindex, which a change to the block file format would. Improving pruning behavior is also not the goal here.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I think the proof of work and integrity checks done on loading the index already provide fairly solid guarantees on load, but agree that we should do better. I have also talked to some other people about it offline, and there seems to be some appetite for improving corruption resistance. It is my understanding that the feature for reindexing the block tree was added as a salvaging option, because leveldb does not provide strong anti-corruption guarantees, but has sprawled a bit since. Removing the need to provide code for reindexing the block tree would be a nice simplification of validation code in my eyes. I think adding a checksum for the entries and writing from a log file could be fairly simple to implement and provide strong guarantees. I'm open to suggestions here.\r\n\r\n> I also think another alternative could be to use sqlite for this since this would not necessarily introduce a new dependency and we already have a [ReadKey/WriteKey/EraseKey/HasKey](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6d5edfcc585bab3374ae14aa7918b3e178e016aa/src/wallet/sqlite.h#L76-L80) wrapper functions for sqlite that might help it be an easy replacement for leveldb.\r\n\r\nThis has also been brought up by some others. While I'm still not sure that we should be introducing a new validation dependency, maybe it would be good to implement it and open the change as an alternative draft / RFC pull request in the meantime?",

      "body": "re: TheCharlatan https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32427#issuecomment-2859921949\r\n\r\nThanks for clarifying the situation with leveldb. I just assumed based on its design that it would support atomic updates pretty robustly but if it has corruption problems of its own then it doesn't sound like we would lose much by switching to something simpler.\r\n\r\nI still do think using sqlite could be a nice solution because data consistency issues can be a significant source of pain for users and developers, and with sqlite we basically just don't need to think those issues. But I also understand not wanting to require sqlite as a kernel dependency. \r\n\r\nAnother thing about this PR (as of fabd3ab615a7c718f37a60298a125864edb6106b) is it seems like it doesn't actually remove much blockstorage code, and the BlockTreeDB class remains intact, I guess because migration code depends on it.\r\n\r\nAn idea that might improve this could be to make BlockTreeStore methods pure virtual and have FlatFile and LevelDB subclasses implementing them. This could organize the code more cleanly by letting FlatFile and LevelDB implementations both live side-by side outside of blockstorage instead of one being inside and one being outside. This could also let kernel applications provide alternate backends, and allow things like differential fuzz testing. (This was also the exact same approach used to replace bdb with sqlite in the wallet.)\r\n\r\nre: Sjors https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32427#issuecomment-2861994398\r\n\r\nFWIW I also think using individual block files could be great (assuming a sharded directory structure like the .git/objects to avoid having many files per directory). That idea is mostly tangential to this PR though, I think? Possible I am missing some connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I agree with you that if that is something we need to be able to salvage from, that the reindex logic would have to remain for it. If that is the case though, shouldn't we also be cleaning left over block data then? Seems like the user could just end up with 100's of GBs of unusable block data otherwise.",

Neat :)\r\n\r\n> Maybe this is not an issue for the PR, but it would be good to make clear what types of corruption BlockTreeStore can and can't detect and what types of corruption it can recover from.

I'm onboard for a new impl outside of leveldb, but before getting too deep into the implementation itself we need to decide 2 main things:\r\n\r\n1. Is the current block/index storage layout ideal? I think @Sjors's one-block-per-file idea is interesting. Undo data could go in the same file without breaking any append-only guarantees. Not requiring file offset record keeping sounds nice. But what would the consequences be? Do any filesystems hate that type of dir layout? Would performance suffer due to a bajillion opens/closes?\r\n2. After figuring out 1, like @ryanofsky asked, what guarantees do we need to provide? Are we just protecting against power outages? Cosmic bit-flip corruption? Bad sectors? Malicious users?\r\n\r\nThe impl here with no slicing or atomicity attempts isn't very robust, but that's obviously fine for an RFC. ",

In the rare case where they happen, detecting them early on Bitcoin Core startup (before a validation-internal assert is hit) may help finding the root-cause and also could free up some developer time due to making it easier to remote-diagnose hardware issues (many of them have more than 5 comments: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%20memtest86). So I'd see it as a benefit if this change can provide stronger detection-checks than leveldb.",

I think it would be good to have a test for parallel reads/writes here as well as a demo branch for the library.",

The class is very similar to the existing\nCBlockTreeDB, which stores the same data in a leveldb database. Unlike\nCBlockTreeDB, the data stored through the BlockTreeStore is directly\nserialized and written to flat .dat files. The storage schema introduced\nis simple. It relies on the assumption that no entry is ever\ndeleted and that no duplicate entries are written. These assumptions\nhold for the current users of CBlockTreeDB.\n\nIn order to efficiently update a CBlockIndex entry in the store, a new\nfield is added to the class that tracks its position in the file. New\nserialization wrappers are added for both the CBlockIndex and\nCBlockFileInfo classes to avoid serializing integers as VARINT. Using\nVARINT encoding would make updating these fields impossible, since\nchanging them might overwrite existing entries in the file.\n\nThe new store supports atomic writes by using a write ahead log. Boolean\nflags are persisted through the (non-)existence of certain files. Data\nintegrity is verified through the use of crc32c checksums on each data\nentry.\n\nThis commit is part of a series to replace the leveldb database\ncurrently used for storing block indexes and headers with a flat file\nstorage. This is motivated by the kernel library, where the usage of\nleveldb is a limiting factor to its future use cases.

      "message": "kernel: Add blocktreestorage module\n\nThe BlockTreeStore introduces a new data format for storing block\nindexes and headers on disk. The class is very similar to the existing\nCBlockTreeDB, which stores the same data in a leveldb database. Unlike\nCBlockTreeDB, the data stored through the BlockTreeStore is directly\nserialized and written to flat .dat files. The storage schema introduced\nis simple. It relies on the assumption that no entry is ever\ndeleted and that no duplicate entries are written. These assumptions\nhold for the current users of CBlockTreeDB.\n\nIn order to efficiently update a CBlockIndex entry in the store, a new\nfield is added to the class that tracks its position in the file. New\nserialization wrappers are added for both the CBlockIndex and\nCBlockFileInfo classes to avoid serializing integers as VARINT. Using\nVARINT encoding would make updating these fields impossible, since\nchanging them might overwrite existing entries in the file.\n\nThe new store supports atomic writes by using a write ahead log. Boolean\nflags are persisted through the (non-)existence of certain files. Data\nintegrity is verified through the use of crc32c checksums on each data\nentry.\n\nThis commit is part of a series to replace the leveldb database\ncurrently used for storing block indexes and headers with a flat file\nstorage. This is motivated by the kernel library, where the usage of\nleveldb is a limiting factor to its future use cases. It also offers better\nperformance and has a smaller on-disk footprint, though this is mostly\nnegligible in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAlso make flags based on file existence, instead of complicated boolean\nfields.

    "body": "Main motivation of this PR is to enable #32379 without creating a censorship problem where the attacker sends a witness-stripped version of a transaction to cause us to reject its child. It does this by removing all queries to the rejection caches by txid.\r\n\r\nTLDR, this PR removes the rejection cache filtering part of all txid-based tx requests. In practice, this seems to only be used for orphan resolution because everybody supports wtxidrelay. And so in essence, this PR removes the logic that stops us from attempting orphan resolution when parents are found in the rejection filter.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nWe have 2 bloom filters for remembering transactions that we've rejected so we don't redownload them, `RecentRejectsFilter` and `RecentRejectsReconsiderableFilter`. This lets us save a little bit of bandwidth on rejected transactions, particularly if we have policy differences. It's not designed to stop attackers from wasting our download bandwidth, as they can create as many policy-invalid transactions with different witnesses as they want. We generally only put wtxids and not txids in them (see #18044), except for these cases:\r\n(A) When we specifically know that the rejection reason is not due to the witness\r\n(B) When the transaction has no witness, so its txid == wtxid\r\n(C) (With #32379) When the transaction's witness has been stripped, so txid == wtxid\r\n\r\n\"Will this increase bandwidth usage?\"\r\nWe check the filters to decide whether to send a getdata for an inv, whether we should validate a tx we just downloaded, and whether we should keep an orphan: we look the missing parents up by (prevout) txid and throw the orphan away if its parents were already rejected. That means there are very few cases where we save bandwidth by finding a txid in the filter. I collected some stats over a couple of weeks:\r\n- When we receive an announcement by txid (i.e. the peer does not support BIP339 wtxidrelay) and somehow the txid is already in the filter (see cases ABC)\r\n  - On my node, I'm seeing 100% of peers support wtxidrelay. Bitcoin Core has been doing this since ~5 years ago. I'm sure there are some nodes that don't do it, but it'll probably be rare that we are surrounded by txidrelay peers and that we have a policy difference causing us to reject the transaction that they all send us.\r\n- When an orphan parent has been placed in the rejection cache (see cases ABC)\r\n  - On my node, orphan parent fetching is only 3.64% of my transaction requests, and this is after I set mempoolexpiry to 1 hour to try to artificially increase orphan rates, though I don't know whether the effect is significant.\r\n  - 93.77% of all transactions I receive have witnesses (includes accepted and rejected ones). 96.20% of orphan parents I fetched had witnesses.\r\n  - I actually haven't found any cases of already-rejected parent txids in the past week, but the number of nonsegwit orphan parents is just so tiny - a few dozen requests per day.",

      "body": "> TLDR, this PR removes the rejection cache filtering part of all txid-based tx requests.\r\n\r\nThere's three cases here I think:\r\n\r\n * orphan resolution from wtxidrelay peers (WTXIDRELAY)\r\n * tx relay from segwit-supporting, non-wtxidrelay peers (NODE_WITNESS, no WTXIDRELAY, 0.13.1 to 0.20.x, Jan 2021)\r\n * tx relay from non-segwit peers\r\n\r\nThe last case case is trivial -- non-segwit peers can be treated as doing wtxid relay for caching because all the txs they relay will have the same value for txid and wtxid.\r\n\r\nFor orphan resolution, caching bad txids seems mostly undesirable: we can cache INPUTS_NON_STANDARD since that will fail repeatedly, but can't cache anything much else, as different witness could make an acceptable transaction. I think it should be possible to detect INPUTS_NON_STANDARD versus WITNESS_STRIPPED or other failures, so I think that behaviour could actually be retained? Something like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nstatic bool RequiresWitnessData(TxoutType txo)\r\n{\r\n    switch(txo) {\r\n    case WITNESS_V0_SCRIPTHASH:\r\n    case WITNESS_V0_KEYHASH:\r\n    case WITNESS_V1_TAPROOT:\r\n        return true;\r\n    default: // should list all cases for completeness and compiler checks\r\n         break;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbool AreInputsStandard(const CTransaction& tx, const CCoinsViewCache& mapInputs, bool& is_stripped)\r\n{\r\n    is_stripped = false;\r\n    ...\r\n    const bool has_witness_data = tx.HasWitness();\r\n    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < tx.vin.size(); i++) {\r\n        const CTxOut& prev = mapInputs.AccessCoin(tx.vin[i].prevout).out;\r\n\r\n        std::vector<std::vector<unsigned char> > vSolutions;\r\n        TxoutType whichType = Solver(prev.scriptPubKey, vSolutions);\r\n        if (!has_witness_data && !is_stripped && RequiresWitnessData(whichType)) {\r\n            is_stripped = true;\r\n        }\r\n        if (whichType == TxoutType::NONSTANDARD || whichType == TxoutType::WITNESS_UNKNOWN) {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n    if (is_stripped) return false;\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n\r\n    bool is_stripped;\r\n    if (m_pool.m_opts.require_standard && !AreInputsStandard(tx, m_view, is_strippped)) {\r\n        if (is_stripped) {\r\n            return state.Invalid(TxValidationResult::TX_WITNESS_STRIPPED, \"bad-txns-missing-witness\");\r\n        } else { \r\n            return state.Invalid(TxValidationResult::TX_INPUTS_NOT_STANDARD, \"bad-txns-nonstandard-inputs\");\r\n         }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n(just passing `state` through probably would be better than the bool ref)\r\n\r\n`WITNESS_STRIPPED` would indicate you should retry requesting by txid for orphan resolution; `INPUTS_NOT_STANDARD` means there's no point retrying. Other errors also indicate you should retry -- a tx with the same txid but different witness data may pass validation.\r\n\r\nIn that case, I believe adding the wtxid to the reject filter, and `INPUTS_NOT_STANDARD` txids to the reject filter, and checking the reject filter when requestion both by wtxid and txid would give good/correct behaviour for wtxidrelay and non-segwit peers, and I think best-possible behavour for non-wtxidrelay segwit peers?",

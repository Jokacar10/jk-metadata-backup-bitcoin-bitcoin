Increment the checkout depth to HEAD~~ to compensate for the new merge commit.\r\n\r\nThis would have likely helped avoid both failures reported in #31946, and seems to me to be a more robust way of running this test job in any case.\r\n\r\n(Probably) closes: #31946\r\n\r\ncc @maflcko: Is there a historical reason I'm missing here why a merge-checkout was not chosen for this job in fafcd2e9ef1209d614de5763a2733098537919dd?",

However, this is not possible in general, as some commits are not possible to rebase. For example, a subtree merge commit is not possible to rebase.\r\n\r\nAlso, the goal of this check is to find bisect errors early, so the whole point is to run on the original changes, not merged into master.\r\n\r\nThinking about alternative fixes, obviously the best fix would be to not have any intermittent issues. Absent that, it would be good for devs to rebase on latest master if they want to ensure the CI gets all the latest fixes. Alternatively, failures in this task could be ignored or the task could be re-run.",

      "body": "> It looks like you are trying to change the task to test changes merged into master to avoid running into issues fixed previously.\r\n\r\nCorrect. Whilst we can try to rely on developers keeping up-to-date with rebases on master it seems less error-prone to do it as part of the task.\r\n\r\n> However, you check out the previous commit, so overall this change is a no-op , unless I am missing something?\r\n> \r\n> Maybe you wanted to instead _rebase_ the changes onto master? However, this is not possible in general, as some commits are not possible to rebase. For example, a subtree merge commit is not possible to rebase.\r\n\r\nYes you're right, I think the correct checkout command would in fact be `git checkout HEAD^2` as `HEAD~~` does indeed skip back to the previous merge commit, which is not what was intended here. AFAIK a merge would work with a subtree merge commit?\r\n\r\n> Also, the goal of this check is to find bisect errors early, so the whole point is to run on the original changes, not merged into master.\r\n> \r\n> Thinking about alternative fixes, obviously the best fix would be to not have any intermittent issues. Absent that, it would be good for devs to rebase on latest master if they want to ensure the CI gets all the latest fixes. Alternatively, failures in this task could be ignored or the task could be re-run.\r\n\r\nFair enough. Ignoring failures in this task seems a little sub-optimal to me though.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be to auto-prompt a rebase on failure, something like:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Details</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/.github/workflows/ci.yml b/.github/workflows/ci.yml\r\nindex 4f0ed47b951..9e75bf0a258 100644\r\n--- a/.github/workflows/ci.yml\r\n+++ b/.github/workflows/ci.yml\r\n@@ -69,11 +69,18 @@ jobs:\r\n           sudo apt-get update\r\n           sudo apt-get install clang ccache build-essential cmake pkgconf python3-zmq libevent-dev libboost-dev libsqlite3-dev libdb++-dev systemtap-sdt-dev libzmq3-dev qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools qtwayland5 libqrencode-dev -y\r\n       - name: Compile and run tests\r\n+        id: run_tests\r\n         run: |\r\n           # Run tests on commits after the last merge commit and before the PR head commit\r\n           # Use clang++, because it is a bit faster and uses less memory than g++\r\n           git rebase --exec \"echo Running test-one-commit on \\$( git log -1 ) && CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -B build -DWERROR=ON -DWITH_ZMQ=ON -DBUILD_GUI=ON -DBUILD_BENCH=ON -DBUILD_FUZZ_BINARY=ON -DWITH_BDB=ON -DWITH_USDT=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-Wno-error=unused-member-function' && cmake --build build -j $(nproc) && ctest --output-on-failure --stop-on-failure --test-dir build -j $(nproc) && ./build/test/functional/test_runner.py -j $(( $(nproc) * 2 )) --combinedlogslen=99999999\" ${{ env.TEST_BASE }}\r\n \r\n+      - name: Suggest rebase\r\n+        if: failure() && steps.run_tests.outcome == 'failure'\r\n+        run: |\r\n+          echo \"If you haven't already, please try rebasing your branch on the latest master\"\r\n+          exit 1\r\n+\r\n   macos-native-arm64:\r\n     name: ${{ matrix.job-name }}\r\n     # Use any image to support the xcode-select below, but hardcode version to avoid silent upgrades (and breaks).\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it sounds like it would be best to close this (and #31946 ? ) ?\r\n",

    "body": "If the chain advances during a rescan, ScanForWalletTransactions would previously process the new blocks without adjusting `m_last_processed_block`, which would leave the wallet in an inconsistent state temporarily, and could lead to crashes in the GUI reported in #31474.\r\nFix this by not rescanning blocks beyond `m_last_processed_block` - for all blocks beyond that height, there will be pending BlockConnected notifications that will process them after the rescan is finished.\r\n\r\nThis means that if rescanning was triggered with `cs_wallet` permanently held (`AttachChain`), additional blocks that were connected during the rescan will only be processed with the pending `blockConnected` notifications after the lock is released.\r\nIf rescanning without a permanent `cs_wallet` lock (`RescanFromTime`), additional blocks that were connected during the rescan can be re-processed here because `m_last_processed_block` was already updated by `blockConnected`.\r\n\r\nFixes #31474",

But I think that other existing callers of `ScanForWalletTransactions`  that don't want to set `max_height` can have the same problem too:\r\nThese callers don't lock the wallet permamently, and for them, reprocessing additional blocks during the rescan will be correct if the notification was already processed, incorrect if it was pending, so there could be race for them on current master.\r\nI like that the current solution fixes the issue for these other callers as well.\r\nBesides, if we set `max_height` we'd need to do more changes, because mempool scanning is currently coupled to `max_height` not being set (but that might be good to decouple anyways).",

      "body": "After a few conversations with mzumzande, it seems to me that we could split the \"scan blocks beyond the last processed block\" issue into two scenarios:\r\n\r\n(1) when the wallet mutex is locked for the entire time the rescanning process is executed. And (2) when the wallet mutex is not locked for the entire rescanning time.\r\n\r\n(1) Is #31474 case: \r\nGiven that we set the \"last processed block\" to the chain tip just before calling the initial rescan. I do think this process expects to stop at the \"last processed block\" as any new coming block will be processed after this process finishes.\r\nThe only thing preventing us from fixing this just by providing the correct `max_height` is that the mempool scanning process is tied to it. But I don’t see why this should always be the case. I’d advocate for decoupling it, as scanning the mempool could be useful independently of rescanning the blockchain.\r\n\r\n(2) is the`rescanblockchain/importdescriptors/importmulti` cases:\r\nBecause in this case we do not keep the wallet mutex locked the entire time, new blocks are processed during rescan rather than after it, which makes this trickier to solve because while rescanning is in progress, the wallet may receive a new block event and ignore it if it doesn’t contain any relevant transactions. But.. what if rescanning later finds a relevant script? That would mean the wallet’s look-ahead script pool will be expanded, potentially leading to new scripts being detected in previously ignored blocks. So the user might need to rescan those blocks too.\r\n\r\nI think we could solve the first case here, so it can get inside the upcoming release, and leave the second case for a follow-up. Also, I'm not really against the fix proposed in this PR, it works. It just feels a bit hacky.",

Also, I'm not really against the fix proposed in this PR, it works. It just feels a bit hacky.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/tree/202502_rescan_initfix for this alternative. Happy to change it to that if people like it better. This fixes the issue during `AttachChain()` and is admittedly nicer, but it wouldn't fix the following race:\r\n1) User runs `rescanblockchain` rpc with no stop height -> ScanForWalletTransactions runs without permanent lock of the wallet mutex\r\n2) Node connects a block -> race between  ScanForWalletTransactions and blockConnected signal\r\n3) ScanForWalletTransactions processes this blocks first (so that m_last_processed_block is behind the actual last processed block).\r\n4) wallet is temporarily in a inconsistent state / GUI can crash (until the queued blockConnected signal is executed).\r\n\r\nNot requiring a stop height during rescanblockchain (or internally setting it to the tip at its start) could be seen a feature that makes the need for repeated scans less likely (as furszy described above), so the same approach as in `AttachChain` probably wouldn't be great there?!",

    "body": "Instead of marking `-datacarrier` and `-datacarriersize` options as deprecated, only say that these options are not recommended for use.\r\n\r\nWhile deprecation obviously means that the options are not recommended for use, many users seem to believe that it also means that the options will be imminently removed. My understanding is that there is currently no plan to remove these options in the near future, and I don't think it would be wise to open a PR to remove the options for a few more years. While deprecation certainly does not give a timeline for removal, and the current text is still technically correct, I think that it would be clearer to users to remove the word \"deprecated\" from the documentation of this option while preserving the non-recommendation.\r\n\r\nOne thing that could be bikeshed is whether to warn on init if these options are set. IMO we should not have removal warnings if there is no current plan to actually remove them.",

There the deprecation itself was a mistake, because there were good technical reasons for users to keep using username and password.

      "body": "Concept NACK\r\n\r\nI personally prefer to keep the deprecation warning as I think all the rationale given (among many other places) [here](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/06/06/relay-statement/) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#issuecomment-2955614286) points to the fact that it should be removed some time in the future. The fact that outsiders don't understand deprecation and how it is handled in Bitcoin Core is not a strong argument. I am also surprised by this because the [original PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32359) that just removed the option outright seemed to have broad support among contributors. I was one of the few reviewers to ask for a deprecation period as far as I can remember.\r\n\r\nI have also seen contributors express aversion to revisit this discussion again in the future. This was given as a rationale to not increase the limit in steps as needed by layer 2 protocols but to remove the limit completely, for example. This PR adds another step in the future when we actually want to remove the option. We'll have drama for the deprecation PR and the removal, rather than just the removal as it stand currently.\r\n\r\nAs others have noted before the deprecation can be walked back any time in the future if there are better reasons for keeping the option in place long term.",

If it were just up to me, I'd choose (b) over (a), but it's not a terribly strong opinion.\r\n\r\n> My understanding is that there is currently no plan to remove these options in the near future, and I don't think it would be wise to open a PR to remove the options for a few more years.\r\n\r\n> Both `-datacarrier` and `-datacarriersize` options have been marked as deprecated and are expected to be removed in a future release. (#32406)`\r\n\r\n> `        InitWarning(_(\"Options '-datacarrier' or '-datacarriersize' are set but are marked as deprecated. They will be removed in a future version.\"));`\r\n\r\nI think various contributors would like to remove the options in the near future, and both marking the option as deprecated and having explicit warnings about the feature being removed on startup and in the release notes lends support to those opinions. I also think it's hard to justify keeping around an option that we recommend nobody use for a long period of time.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it would make more sense to take the following approach:\r\n\r\n * decide what we think the default behaviour should be (ie, relay/mine txs with an arbitrary number of OP_RETURN outputs, of arbitrary length)\r\n * determine if enough users seem interested in alternative behaviours to justify providing/maintaining a runtime configuration option (sure seems like there are)\r\n * observe if that configuration option is useful in practice on the network (ie, some level of hashpower actually changes from the default behaviour -- not observable at the moment because the new default behaviour isn't even available in released software)\r\n   * if 99.9% of hashpower (or some other number) seems satisfied with the default behaviour, remove the option, possibly with a deprecation period\r\n   * on the other hand, if a majority of hashpower (or plurality?) is using some different behaviour to our default, even after a release with the new default has been out for some time, seriously consider changing our defaults to match that behaviour\r\n\r\nTaking that approach would mean not deprecating the option until after a release with the new default has been out for some time.",

    "body": "This is one of several PRs to cleanup/modernize our threading primitives.\r\n\r\nWhile replacing the old critical section locks in the mining code with a `REVERSE_LOCK`, I noticed that our thread-safety annotations weren't hooked up to it. This PR gets `REVERSE_LOCK` working properly.\r\n\r\nFirstly it modernizes the attributes as-recommended by the [clang docs](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html) (ctrl+f for `USE_LOCK_STYLE_THREAD_SAFETY_ATTRIBUTES`). There's a subtle difference between the old `unlock_function` and new `release_capability`, where our `reverse_lock` only works with the latter. I believe this is an upstream bug. I've [reported and attempted a fix here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/139343), but either way it makes sense to me to modernize.\r\n\r\nThe second commit just fixes an unrelated logging bug that I noticed while hacking around in here.\r\n\r\nThe third adds a missing annotation pointed out by a fixed `REVERSE_LOCK`. Because clang's thread-safety annotations aren't passed through a reference to `UniqueLock` as one may assume (see [here](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#no-alias-analysis) for more details), `cs_main` has to be listed explicitly as a requirement.\r\n\r\nThe last commit actually fixes the `reverse_lock` by making it a `SCOPED_LOCK` and using the pattern [found in a clang test](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/SemaCXX/warn-thread-safety-analysis.cpp#L3126). Though the docs don't describe how to accomplish it, the functionality was added [in this commit](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/6a68efc959bd1024506bf661a9e155de8a8440da). Due to aliasing issues (see link above), in order to work correctly, the original mutex has to be passed along with the lock, so all existing `REVERSE_LOCK`s have been updated. To ensure that the mutexes actually match, a runtime assertion is added.",

To avoid having to update our macro usage throughout the codebase, I\nreused our existing ones.\n\nAdditionally, SHARED_UNLOCK_FUNCTION is added here, as a subsequent PR will\nintroduce annotations for shared_mutex and shared_lock.",

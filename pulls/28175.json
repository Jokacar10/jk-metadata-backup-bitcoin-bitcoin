      "body": "To be honest, and after looking on some LLM-term of service and in basic knowledge of copyright law, there is an uncertainty on the status of LLM output. It sounds LLM or AI operating platforms in their terms of service do no make the claim they own the intellectual property of the LLM output, and if even if they do so it’s probably an unfounded claim. A user might mix an “original” or “creative” element by sending an individual prompt request, a determining factor in any matter of intellectual property rights assignment.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my knowledge there has been no legal precedent on the matter in any major jurisdiction. However, there are ongoing proposals to rework legal framework in matter of data use and AI (at least in the EU), and this will be probably change the question.\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion would be to left the contributing rules unchanged for now and looked again in 24 / 36 months when there is more clarity on the matter, if any.\r\n\r\nSee also the recent page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models_and_copyright",

Potentially owned by some corporation who didn't give permission to the person making the pull request to MIT license it.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to (1) I'm more worried about snippets of fresh code than e.g. suggested refactorings. I don't see how one can claim copyright over e.g. the use of `std::map` over `std::vector`.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to (2) in a way it's not a new risk. A contributor could already have a consultant standing next to them telling them what to write. It could then turn out the code belongs to that consultant (who didn't license it MIT) and not contributor (who at least implicitly did).

In this event, the per-peer inventory queues can grow too large.\r\n\r\nThis commit bumps the rate up to 14 tx/s (for inbound peers), increasing the safety margin by a factor of 2.\r\n\r\nOutbound peers continue to receive relayed transactions at 2.5x the rate of inbound peers, for a rate of 35tx/second.",

With this change, going through `m_tx_inventory_to_send` will be more predictable and reactive, making the tx relay smoother.\r\n\r\nI also checked that the `catch up` code introduced in 5b3406094f2679dfb3763de4414257268565b943 still makes sense. (I think the commit message from there better be in the code because the `division by 1000` is not trivial).\r\nI think catching up will become slower in the case when `m_tx_inventory_to_send` is around 1,000,000; but I think it's fine.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI also want to note that it's not exactly the relay rate, it's the rate of going through the queue.

We can't really stop our peers from wasting bandwidth by sending tx data to us, but we can be kind to our peers, and only relay tx data that's likely to be mined: so we pick the top set of txs (`CompareInvMempoolOrder`) trim the txs that the peer has announced to us, and then limit that to a rate somewhat around what can reasonably be confirmed.\r\n\r\n(Note that the we'll send txs faster to our outbounds by a factor of 2.5x (35tx/2s instead of 35tx/5s), and that we don't announce txs that have been announced to us also has a multiplying effect)\r\n\r\nThe drawback of having this number be too low is thus (a) that txs may not propagate well, and this may affect txs that should go in the next blocks if feerates are rising, and (b) that our internal queues of what to send (`m_tx_inventory_to_send`) may grow large. The drawback of having this number be too high is that we will waste our peers' bandwidth and cpu by giving them more txs than can possibly go into blocks, which they'll then have to validate and may in turn relay onwards.",

      "body": ">  The drawback of having this number be too high is that we will waste our peers' bandwidth and cpu by giving them more txs than can possibly go into blocks, which they'll then have to validate and may in turn relay onwards.\r\n\r\nJust to expand on this a bit more, a benefit of this number not being too high is that we reserve some of the network's relay capacity for higher feerate transactions that might show up after, say, a flood of low feerate transactions arrives.\r\n\r\nIf we had no limit at all, then you could think of relay as being much more like a big FIFO queue, where the first transactions announced are the ones that end up being relayed to everyone. By buffering transactions, we allow higher feerate ones that are announced later to jump the queue. \r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7805, where gmaxwell originally proposed this behavior (before it was adopted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7840).",

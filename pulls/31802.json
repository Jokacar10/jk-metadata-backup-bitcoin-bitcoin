    "body": "Have depends make libmultiprocess by default. This PR causes the following behavior changes:\r\n\r\n1. **bitcoin-node and bitcoin-gui binaries are included in releases**, due to `ENABLE_IPC` option being switched on by default in depends builds\r\n2. `ENABLE_IPC` is also switched on by default in non-depends builds (instructions updated, #33190 does this as a standalone PR)\r\n3. Various changes to CI: switching on `ENABLE_IPC` on in most configurations and using `bitcoin-node` binary (`bitcoin -m`) for functional tests in two of them.\r\n4. The `bitcoin-node` and `bitcoin-gui` are added to `Maintenance.cmake` (since they're now in the release)\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't need to do all of these things at once. However it's is simpler, avoids code churn (especially in CI), and  probably less confusing to make all these changes in the same PR.\r\n\r\nWindows is not supported yet, so `ENABLE_IPC` is off by default for it. It can be enabled after https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32387.\r\n\r\nThe initial main use case for IPC is to enable experimental support for the Mining IPC interface. A working example of a Stratum v2 Template Provider client using this interface can be found here: https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48. \r\n\r\nSee #31756 for discussion of when this should happen. Supersedes #30975.\r\n\r\n## Wait what, why?\r\n\r\nThe [Stratum v2 spec](https://stratumprotocol.org/specification) has been around for a few years now, mostly stable but with [ongoing activity](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/commits/main/) to clarify and fix more subtle issues encountered by implementers. Most of the implementation is built in Rust in a project called the Stratum Reference Implementation ([SRI](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum)).\r\n\r\n[Braiins](https://demand.work) added Stratum v2 support to both their (custom) firmware and pool several years ago, though they have fallen behind on recent spec changes (update: it seems they've fixed that). Apparently [new hardware is underway](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#issuecomment-3189623427) that supports Stratum v2 without the need for custom firmware. \r\n\r\n[DMND pool](https://www.dmnd.work) is Stratum v2 native from the start and employs several of the SRI developers (they haven't fully launched though). The industry is rather secretive, but apparently [there is more underway](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#issuecomment-3190601926).\r\n\r\nWhat does Bitcoin Core have to do with this? Well, in Stratum v2 jargon we are the Template Provider.\r\n\r\nOr at least, the Template Provider role needs us to make block templates. Initially back in 2023 the plan was to have Bitcoin Core implement this role entirely, see #23049. It would speak the sv2 encrypted message protocol. In fact the spec was designed around this assumption, making sure to only use cryptographic primitives already in our codebase.\r\n\r\nI took over that effort in late 2023, but during 2024 it became quite clear there was [strong resistance](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29432#pullrequestreview-2132699185) to the idea of including all this new code, opening another network ports, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there was the long running multiprocess / IPC project #10102, and the idea was born to apply that here: instead of including Stratum v2 specific stuff, we offer a general Mining interface via an IPC connection that can e.g. push out fresh block templates as fees rise above a threshold (something not possible and/or very inefficient with `getblocktemplate`). A client sidecar application then sits between the Stratum v2 world and our node.\r\n\r\nCurrently there's only one such sidecar application, maintained by me, and reusing the same codebase from the integrated approach. An attempt has been made to connect to our interface from Rust https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/issues/174, which would pave the way for SRI include the Template Provider role. Plebhash below indicates he's also working on that: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#issuecomment-3191547244.\r\n\r\nSo with this new approach in mind, between mid 2024 until spring 2025, I introduced a new Mining interface (#30200 - #31785). At the same time Russ Ryanosky worked on more tight integration of [libmultiprocess](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess), including making it a subtree in #31741. See [design/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/multiprocess.md).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I've been maintaining a fork of Bitcoin Core that includes the Template Provider, in the original integrated approach (https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/68) as well as an IPC + sidecar variant (https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48). I've been shipping [regular releases](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/releases), mostly after bug fixes or major rebases. The SRI team has been testing both variants, though the \"official\" [instruction on their web page](https://stratumprotocol.org/developers) is to stick to integrated version. Bug reports on [my repo fork](https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue) as well as on the [SRI repo](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%20label%3A%22template%20provider%22) are evidence of actual testing happening.\r\n\r\nBut as Pavlenex writes below:\r\n\r\n> one recurring feedback I kept getting regardless of the size/type of miner is that the need to run a forked version of Bitcoin Core remains a significant barrier to adoption\r\n\r\nThis PR gets rids of that significant barrier. People can download a \"pristine\" version of Bitcoin Core and the only change is to start it with `bitcoin node -m -ipcconnect=unix` instead of the usual `bitcoind`.\r\n\r\nOnce that's released, I can dramatically simplify my sidecar codebase (https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/48) by removing pretty much all Bitcoin Core code  that it doesn't need. My plan is to then make that a separate repository, which should be much easier to contribute to. I can then also make (deterministically built) signed releases, while making it clear that sidecar code has nothing to do with Bitcoin Core. Perhaps later on SRI implements the same and I can stop maintaining that project.\r\n\r\nConceptually the situation will be a lot clearer;\r\n- today: download forked version of `bitcoind` (or a forked version of `bitcoin-node`, plus `bitcoin-mine`), install SRI stuff\r\n- tomorrow: download Bitcoin Core v30, install `bitcoin-mine` and SRI\r\n- future: download Bitcoin Core v30 and SRI\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\nGuix hashes:\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nfind guix-build-$(git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD)/output/ -type f -print0 | env LC_ALL=C sort -z | xargs -r0

Given recent momentum i estimate it's possible we might release multiprocess in \r\n                     30.0, which means if we want to deprecate the bitcoin-wallet utility name we should do it.. now?\r\n17:33:31 < sipa> bitcoin-wallet-util ?\r\n...\r\n23:38:57 < _aj_> darosior: bitcoin-wallet-process, bitcoin-gui-process, etc? it's multi *-process!\r\n03:04:34 < Sjors[m]> darosior: at the moment there is no wallet binary if were to enable multiprocess. That won't happen until #19460.\r\n...\r\n03:05:18 < Sjors[m]> Or maybe already in #10102\r\n...\r\n03:05:50 < Sjors[m]> In any case #31802 only adds bitcoin-node and bitcoin-gui.\r\n...\r\n03:07:19 < Sjors[m]> Though if we want to rename the utility eventually, it's always better to do it early.\r\n```",

I think it might be good for PR to clearly mention the 3 changes in behavior it causes:\r\n\r\n1 - Causes `bitcoin-node` and `bitcoin-gui` binaries to be included in releases and `ENABLE_IPC` option to be switched on by default in depends builds.\r\n2 - Also causes `ENABLE_IPC` option to be switched on by default in both non-depends builds\r\n3 - Makes various changes to CI: switching on ENABLE_IPC on in most configurations and using `bitcoin-node` binary for functional tests in two of them.\r\n\r\nIt would also be good to point out that that this PR doesn't **need** to do all of 3 things at once. It is simpler and probably less confusing to make all these changes in the same PR, but if we want to isolate any of these things and make them separate, that's possible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#issuecomment-2798079537\r\n\r\nAll the choices you made about CI jobs options seem reasonable, and seem to test everything we would want. But @maflcko has best understanding of CI jobs and might have input.",

There should be no impact in user experience, because thanks to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31375 the recommended invocation `bitcoin -m` will find `bitcoin-node` whether it's in `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/local/libexec`. But an upgrade would leave a stale version of `bitcoin-node` in `bin`, so it's nicer to get that PR _in the same release_ as this one. Merge order shouldn't matter.",

The proposed solution of falling back to the poll()-implementation seems simple enough though, will take a deeper look next week. (Fwiw, I reached out to the author asking if they are still working on this just in case, though the chance after more than a year is close to zero.)",

Also, I think even with EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS disabled, errors similar to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#issuecomment-2858241771 could still happen because that error comes from a header file included via `-I`, not `-isystem`",

Looks like https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/172 did not resolve all the warnings. \r\n\r\nJust taking a quick look:\r\n\r\n- Need to check if this is a real bug:\r\n  - `/usr/include/kj/async-inl.h:609:37: warning: The left operand of '+' is a garbage value [clang-analyzer-core.UndefinedBinaryOperatorResult]`\r\n- Pretty sure this isn't a bug. Changing `[&]` to `[]` should fix it:\r\n  - `/ci_container_base/src/ipc/libmultiprocess/include/mp/proxy-types.h:134:5: warning: Address of stack memory associated with temporary object of type '(lambda at /ci_container_base/src/ipc/libmultiprocess/include/mp/proxy-types.h:134:51)' is still referred to by a temporary object on the stack upon returning to the caller.  This will be a dangling reference [clang-analyzer-core.StackAddressEscape]`\r\n- This might be a test bug:\r\n  - `/ci_container_base/src/ipc/libmultiprocess/include/mp/type-number.h:55:32: warning: The value '0' provided to the cast expression is not in the valid range of values for 'FooEnum' [clang-analyzer-optin.core.EnumCastOutOfRange]`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate: These are all addressed in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/184",

Since last review: squashed commit, updated release notes and reverted ci.yml reformatting. \r\n\r\nMaybe it's just me, but I feel like this PR is more comprehensible now that the squashed depends commit is first. And the new release notes are also much better. (Though I would still like to unify them later with the bitcoin wrapper & libexec notes as suggested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#discussion_r2228654424).\r\n\r\n> I could rename `MULTIPROCESS` to `IPC` in a separate PR, but I don't think that would reduce the scope of this PR noticeably.\r\n\r\nTend to agree, but maybe you could rename `MULTIPROCESS` to `NO_IPC` in a separate PR and have it default to 1? But I'm not sure much that would reduce complexity here either. I feel like most of the the complexity in this PR comes from updating the CI jobs, so maybe if we had a separate PR enabling IPC in CI jobs first, and then this PR could just flip the depends and cmake defaults and be really simple. But conceptually it seems nice if release & developer & CI defaults are all in sync, so I tend to like the PR in its current form. But would be happy with any approach.",

      "body": "Hi everyone, I usually avoid commenting on repos I am not directly contributing to, but I wanted to share some context on the SV2 adoption update as it may be important for the context of this PR. \r\n\r\nOver the past few months, my main work on the SV2 project has been engaging with miners, mining pools, and hardware manufacturers.\r\n\r\nStratum V2 is close to reaching a snowball effect in adoption and having this into version 30.0 would help push that adoption. As @TheBlueMatt noted above, mining is a highly competitive industry, so I don't want to bring up specific names of the companies/farms I've interacted with, but one recurring feedback I kept getting regardless of the size/type of miner is that the need to run a forked version of Bitcoin Core remains a significant barrier to adoption. \r\n\r\nSmall miners for example, are busy trying to keep their ASICS online 24/7 they really don't have engineering capacity or knowledge to put into reviewing our own forked version of core to use SV2, they prefer a plug and play experience.\r\n\r\nRemoving a requirement of running a \"random fork\" to use SV2 would help accelerate SV2 adoption across the ecosystem and delaying that for a few months may harm the momentum. \r\n\r\nIf there's something the SRI (Stratum V2 Reference implementation) FOSS community could do to help,, just let us know.",

Currently people do file bug reports (e.g. https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/issues/72), but I'm the only one who fixes them. However once I strip all unused Bitcoin Core stuff, there's no (easy) way back.\r\n\r\nAt this point I think we've made enough progress towards including IPC into Bitcoin Core that I feel comfortable going in that direction - just after the v30 release. I would much prefer that I can instruct people to use the official v30 release, but otherwise they'll have to use a v30+IPC release from me for a while.\r\n\r\n",

I can see how this makes sense and is probably a good example to follow for ENABLE_IPC.\r\n\r\nI do think the most important things this PR is doing are (1) making IPC available in binary releases and (2) enabling the IPC build and tests in many more CI jobs. What the cmake default is shouldn't matter as much since it should be pretty easy for anybody who is building to change, but I tend to agree it would be good if this PR left it off of default or a followup turned it off.",

I don't have a strong preference.\r\n\r\nCapnp is substantially quicker to install than qt and doesn't slow down the full build as much as the GUI does, so that's not the best comparison. Comparison to the wallet isn't perfect either; they both add to the build time, but sqlite3 is more widely packaged (though so far I've only found OpenBSD to be a problem for capnp, where it needs to be installed from source).\r\n\r\nMy preference is to keep the PR as is and see if capnp actually causes problems for people building on master. We'll need to know about such issues anyway if we want to continue the bigger multiprocess project.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#32345 has landed. I previously tested that that PR won't cause CI issues. So to preserve acks I won't rebase unless I need to retouch for other reasons. ",

EDIT: Contents below have been been updated after this was initially posted as discussion progressed.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n  \r\n  - ryanofsky: current ack, low level reviews\r\n  - ismaelsadeeq: current ack, testing, and comments on documentation and related prs\r\n  - josibase: current ack, high level review, no code comments\r\n  - janb84: current ack, high level review with questions and considerations of tradeoffs\r\n  - fanquake: low level reviews, most thorough build & CI testing, reporting and fixing openbsd & lint/tidy issues previously, and current [gcc 11 / capnproto 0.8](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33176) and [oss-fuzz](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#issuecomment-3198034390) issues. Nacked an earlier version of PR that left cmake IPC default off when not using depends, but now it is on again.\r\n  - achow101: close-seeming review pointing out an inconsistency in cmake code. Current concern about default non-depends cmake option value\r\n  - charlatan: stale high level ack, testing guix build, suggestion to include .capnp files in binary releases which does seem like a good idea for a followup\r\n  - vasild: stale review ack, comments about naming and commit structure\r\n  - maflcko: comments about commit order and spelling, comment suggesting tidy ci fixing\r\n  - BrandonOdiwuor: stale ack, testing of depends & non-depends builds\r\n  - marcofleon: full review, discussion about binary/source distribution\r\n  - sipa, hebasto, theStack: older comments on bitcoin-wallet naming, ci-tidy failure, openbsd compatibility\r\n  - TheBlueMatt, pavlenex, plebhash, average-gary (in [#31756](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31756)): recent high level comments in favor of this change to support Sv2, and dergoegge asking a question about this\r\n  - darosior, sipa, stickies: older higher level comments in [#31756](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/31756) about how and whether we should ship features before they have been widely tested\r\n  - sipa and theuni have added more recent comments (below) pointing out that if an -ipcbind option were added to bitcoind there would be no need for a `bin/bitcoin` wrapper and new binaries in `libexec/`\r\n\r\n### Concerns\r\n\r\n#### oss-fuzz\r\n\r\n- fanquake pointed out new build dependency will [break oss-fuzz](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#issuecomment-3198034390), which I believe we can [address](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/bitcoin-core) by submitting a PR downstream. Previous PRs are https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pulls?q=is%3Apr+bitcoin\r\n\r\n#### ubuntu 22.04\r\n\r\n- fanquake also reported ubuntu 22.04 (older LTS release) build hang https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33176 that seems to be caused by a gcc 11 bug. Different fixes are possible but we will probably go with https://github.com/bitcoin-core/libmultiprocess/pull/194.\r\n\r\n#### cmake ENABLE_IPC default when not using depends\r\n\r\n  - There's been recent disagreement about whether the non-depends build cmake ENABLE_IPC default should be on or off\r\n    - The idea of turning it separately (to encourage more developer testing of IPC) was brought up in last week's IRC meeting and led to an implementation in #33190\r\n    - fanquake nacked a recent iteration of this PR that left it off, because that would put us in a position of shipping releases with a feature turned off in source builds if not using the dev-mode preset or depends. So that change was reverted and it is on again in this PR.\r\n    - achow yesterday pointed out some reasons maybe it should be off: inconvience it could cause and fact that other similar features (GUI, ZMQ, USDT) are also off in non-depends builds\r\n    - IMO (ryanofsky) it doesn't matter too much whether this default is on or off, because cmake and ccmake make it pretty easy to toggle, and I feel like we can pretty easily change it if it causes headaches in practice. In the short term I think I agree with achow that since this option is only useful for mining feature it probably does make sense to leave off, but in the future I hope it will be used for more things (#32297, #29409, #32898, #10102) and have more justification for being on.\r\n    - sipa has commented below saying if the IPC feature is going to be viable in long run, it needs to be used broadly, not just in narrow cases\r\n\r\n#### lack of bitcoind -ipcbind option\r\n\r\n  - This PR only enables `-ipcbind` for the `bitcoin` command not the `bitcoind` command.\r\n  - sipa and theuni are in favor of supporting `bitcoind -ipcbind` because it would allow not adding new binaries to `libexec/`, require all users to run binaries with cap'n proto and libmultiprocess dependencies instead of only some users, and potentially make it more likely that users and developers will test IPC features.\r\n  - ryanofsky is open to the `bitcoind` `-ipcbind` idea but points out ways this could increase medium-term complexity by unbundling the IPC and multiprocess features, and he would not be thrilled about foisting capnproto dependency on users who may not need or want it (especially since a benefit of the `bin/bitcoin`  wrapper and separate `libexec/` directory is making it possible to ship smaller binaries with minimal dependencies without affecting the CLI)\r\n  - This could be discussed further in a new PR or issue or in #30983\r\n\r\n#### conflation of different multiprocess features\r\n\r\n- sipa and theuni pointed out it is bad to require users to explicitly use *multiprocess* flags or binaries just to use `-ipcbind`, because it confuses separate *IPC listening* and *process separation* features which are both enabled by the *multiprocess* dependency.\r\n* ryanofsky agrees and thinks #33229 would solve this by making the `bitcoin -m` option optional, since the `-m` option is the only place the _multiprocess_ term should be currently visible to users.\r\n\r\n#### user confusion from new files\r\n\r\n- theuni pointed out presence of the new `bin/bitcoin` file (already added in master) and `libexec/bitcoin-node` and `libexec/bitcoin-gui` files (added by this PR) in binary releases could cause confusion for users\r\n- ryanofsky pointed out the effects of this should be mitigated by the [readme](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md) file located in the root directory, and general familiarity with the convention of putting user-facing binaries `bin/` but more documentation or different naming might solve potential problems\r\n\r\n### RFM?\r\n\r\nWith all that, I feel PR has had enough to discussion and review to be ready for merge given its impact. (Main impact being adding an `-ipcbind` option in binary releases, and secondary impact changing build system and CI defaults.) So I'm thinking of merging this today, but would appreciate a sanity check and knowing if I'm off-base about anything!",

      "body": "With #33190 closed, I'll comment further here.\r\n\r\n@achow101 @ryanofsky In my [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33190#issuecomment-3196869655) in the other PR regarding seeing this PR as a successor to that one, I failed the consider the possibility of enabling it in release builds without making it default in from-source builds, like Qt, ZMQ, USDT, so I saw it as two separate sequential decisions to be made, rather than seeing them as orthogonal.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think there is a difference with those features. What is being enabled here is nominally an optional feature (in the sense that *right now* all the multiprocess binaries do is add the mining IPC service), but it's really the start of moving towards a multiprocess world, where the new binaries at some point become the \"normal\" way of using the Bitcoin Core daemon. Certainly at that point, I think ENABLE_IPC should be the default, and we should see capnp as a normal expected dependency, rather than an optional extra feature.\r\n\r\nSo my concern is more about how these binaries are being used than about the actual build system and its defaults. With the multiprocess binary *only* useful for the mining IPC, it will effectively, for the time being, only be used by people interested in that (either they build from source with `-DENABLE_IPC=ON`, or they use the release `bitcoin-node` binary with this PR), while ~all others will continue to use non-IPC from-source builds and non-IPC `bitcoind`. I think this is an undesirable situation - shipping an entire new replacement set of binaries that only get eyes/practice from a tiny subset of developers and users. I know not everyone agrees on this, but splitting attention this way for a whole new way of doing this means a reduction in assurance we have.\r\n\r\nMy preference would be to make a decision at some point that we start transitioning to multiprocess as the new way of doing things, so that it gets *all* eyes. That does not need to mean dropping support for non-IPC, and doesn't need to be a hard break that happens on any particular point in time, and it does not need to be now. But that decision would come with enabling it by default in developer builds, moving most/all tests over to use it, adapt documentation to suggest those binaries (or the `bitcoin` binary), etc.\r\n\r\nMaybe today is not yet the time to make that decision, but if we don't, then I think we should treat multiprocess as a second-class and experimental approach.",

      "body": "> I think this is an undesirable situation - shipping an entire new replacement set of binaries that only get eyes/practice from a tiny subset of developers and users.\r\n\r\nThanks for being specific about the negative outcome you see here.\r\n\r\nI think I might not understand the significance of the situation you're describing though. The only difference between the binary that supports the `-ipcbind` option and the binary that does not support it is that one binary is linked against [`init/bitcoind.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init/bitcoind.cpp) and the other is linked against [`init/bitcoin-node.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/init/bitcoin-node.cpp) and the [libbitcoin_ipc library](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/ipc).\r\n\r\nOther than that, the two binaries are identical. They contain the same compiled objects, are built with the same tools, and are verified by the same people. In practice, it shouldn’t matter which binary you run if you’re not using the `-ipcbind` option, either for your own use, or for testing of IPC functionality more broadly.\r\n\r\nI do think we may have different starting assumptions about binary distribution in general. To me, it's a good thing that if you don't use a feature, you don't need to load or install it on your system. If you don't care about IPC you can use `bitcoind` and `rm bitcoin-node` without concern. With #10102, if you only want to run the node and don't care about the wallet or gui, you can `rm bitcoin-wallet` or `rm bitcoin-gui` just as easily. I don't think these things as a huge deal but I do see them as benefits of the modularity that IPC enables.\r\n\r\nI can understand how someone might look at this and come to the opposite conclusion, though. We already provide separate `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` binaries and it's true that `bitcoin-qt` gets less testing than `bitcoind`. If we only provided `bitcoin-qt`, we might have fewer GUI bugs. And the benefits of bundling cut both ways: the wallet benefits from being bundled with the node since it gets installed more widely, but the node also benefits from the wallet since it makes certain test cases easier to write and run.\r\n\r\nI also agree with you about the current state and the end goal for multiprocess support. **In the long term, it makes no sense for multiprocess to remain an optional feature disabled by default**. Ultimately, it should either be enabled by default or dropped. In the meantime, it remains an experimental, second-class feature.\r\n\r\nGetting back to the current PR, I think turning on the `ENABLE_IPC` option by default is going in a direction you support. It is not baking `-ipcbind` option into `bitcoind`, which I see as a good thing, while you see it as a negative. But importantly, this PR does not prevent us from baking IPC/multiprocess support into the `bitcoind` binary in the future if we decide. And I hope it's clear that even if we changed the PR now to bake `-ipcbind` into`bitcoind` and never shipped a `bitcoin-node` binary it would mostly be a symbolic move without much practical effect. It wouldn't meaningfully increase testing of the IPC feature, for example.",

But that's not the only purpose or even the intended one. The point of the option is to turn on IPC features broadly and in later PRs allow running the node, gui, and wallet in separate processes, even separate hosts, and allow them to stop and stop separately and reconnect freely. It changes the way binaries are used and invoked as well as their runtime behavior. This has benefits for flexibility and security but also can make certain gui & wallet interactions slower since it replaces local calls with remote calls and obviously hasn't had as much testing. ENABLE_IPC builds separate binaries to allow developing and testing this feature without forcing a switch right away or requiring the new feature have 100% parity and be fully stable before it is enabled at all. \r\n\r\nThat said, if we want to stick some IPC functionality (`-ipcbind` only, not multiprocess) into `bitcoind` instead of only making it available through the `bitcoin` command we could do that. Then could be a separate ENABLE_MULTIPROCESS option that depends on ENABLE_IPC and controls whether multiprocess features are available.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't preclude doing that and if it makes sipa or others happy it could be a followup. I will say sipa's preference seems mostly symbolic to me and as far as I know doesn't have many practical implications, but that doesn't mean it's not worth following up on.",

      "body": "(Sorry in advance for the meandering comment, I was reading the others coming in as I was typing this up)\r\n\r\n> @achow101 @ryanofsky In my [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33190#issuecomment-3196869655) in the other PR regarding seeing this PR as a successor to that one, I failed the consider the possibility of enabling it in release builds without making it default in from-source builds, like Qt, ZMQ, USDT, so I saw it as two separate sequential decisions to be made, rather than seeing them as orthogonal.\r\n> \r\n> That said, I think there is a difference with those features. What is being enabled here is nominally an optional feature (in the sense that _right now_ all the multiprocess binaries do is add the mining IPC service), but it's really the start of moving towards a multiprocess world, where the new binaries at some point become the \"normal\" way of using the Bitcoin Core daemon. Certainly at that point, I think ENABLE_IPC should be the default, and we should see capnp as a normal expected dependency, rather than an optional extra feature.\r\n\r\nAgreed. I don't think Qt/ZMQ/etc. are analogous to libmultiprocess. IMO the better example is Boost. Boost is required for bitcoind, so it's on by default. If multiprocess binaries are the way forward, we'll need to deal with the headache of that dependency. There's simply no getting around that.\r\n\r\nHaving it on by default forces everyone to grapple with busted gcc's, antiquated system libraries, unsupported operating systems, out-of-date docs, etc. That's _why_ we turn important features on by default.. to _force_ the project as a whole to deal with those issues as they arise. As sipa said above, that's the best way we've found to get eyes on new features. We _want_ to discover those warts before we rely on new features.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Forgive my ignorance, but ISTM a simple solution to @sipa's concern, then, would be for the _only_ release `bitcoind` binary to be the `bitcoin-node` one. Is there some reason why someone should prefer to have run a binary which is simply missing the option (given release builds optionally provide it)? Is there a specific concern with that (you mention you see the separate binary as a \"good thing\") but presumably there's not any (material) risk here for folks who simply don't turn on the ipc option?\r\n\r\nThere's a compromise here.. shipping  the ipc-enabled `bitcoin-node`, with bitcoind as a symlink to it, and none of the other machinery. No `bitcoin`, `bitcoin-gui`, or `bitcoin-wallet` binaries (yet). As @TheBlueMatt suggested, from a casual user's POV, this would JUST be bitcoind with an extra option, but it would not include any of the other binaries that have had less eyes/testing. That would:\r\n- Be transparent to the average user\r\n- Be enough to run sv2\r\n- Not incur (in theory) any extra maintenance burden for the project\r\n\r\nv31 could then ship the other fun binaries once they've been default-on for a release cycle.\r\n...\r\n\r\n(Stopping here, because while typing this out, @ryanofsky responded with some helpful points\r\n\r\n> That said, if we want to stick some IPC functionality (-ipcbind only, not multiprocess) into bitcoind instead of only making it available through the bitcoin command we could do that. Then could be a separate ENABLE_MULTIPROCESS option that depends on ENABLE_IPC and controls whether multiprocess features are available.\r\n>\r\n\r\nI think this is what I was starting to suggest above.\r\n\r\nI realize that ipc/multiprocess is much more than just `bitcoind`+`-ipcbind`, but we really need to look at this from a user's/support perspective. What you outlined above is a substantial departure from how users have always interacted with bitcoin core. Doing a bridge v30 release which adds the machinery to take advantage of sv2 mining without complicating anyone else seems like a reasonable and measured approach to me.\r\n\r\nPlease take a step back and just think like a user. v29 shipped with `bitcoind`. They'll now see `bitcoin`, `bitcoind`, and `bitcoin-node`. Even if their behavior doesn't have to change at all, anyone could be forgiven for being confused by that.\r\n \r\n> This PR doesn't preclude doing that and if it makes sipa or others happy it could be a followup. I will say sipa's preference seems mostly symbolic to me and as far as I know doesn't have many practical implications, but that doesn't mean it's not worth following up on.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's helpful to be so dismissive. Shipping new binaries (but not on all platforms), recommending new ways of running Core, and deprecating old ones shouldn't be taken lightly. The experience you described above makes sense to me, but sounds like it would be confusing to the average bitcoind user (even if they don't have to change anything). Turning ipc/mp on by default would at least force everyday devs to go through the process. I'm not sure how many devs would currently even be able to explain to a user how they should use the new `bitcoin` binary. That's why turning some of this stuff on by default first not just symbolic, but necessary.\r\n\r\ntl;dr:\r\n\r\nFor v30, what makes sense to me is turning on IPC by default for a minimal subset of features that would allow for:\r\n- Requiring all devs to build (lib)multiprocess or manually turn it off\r\n- Exercising the build/release/docs parts of ^^\r\n- Running sv2\r\n\r\nBut not:\r\n- Confusing users with a separate set of binaries\r\n- Suggesting users change their behavior (yet)\r\n\r\nI suppose that basically means changing the defaults to build (and ship) a `bitcoind` with `-ipcbind`, and changing little else.\r\n\r\nThat would be the type of progressive rollout that I would expect from a mature project, at least.",

      "body": "@ryanofsky I wouldn't be opposed to this idea (having `ENABLE_IPC` that enables `-ipcbind` in `bitcoind` itself, separate from `ENABLE_MULTIPROCESS` which enables `bitcoin-node`, and later the broken-out features as separate binaries).\r\n\r\nMultiprocess is more than just IPC, and the mining interface isn't really (or doesn't need to be) part of the multiprocess world, it just happens to use the same interface. Furthermore, at this point there really *isn't* any user-visible multiprocess functionality to speak of, so it would make sense then to have `ENABLE_IPC` in release binaries, but wait with turning on `ENABLE_MULTIPROCESS` until there actually is something to show for.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm also not NACKing this PR, but I feel uneasy about starting the transition towards the multiprocess world at this stage, given the limited eyes and use it has had.",

The new `bitcoin` binary introduced in #31375 is also not directly affected but this PR makes its `-m` option for starting the node or gui with multiprocess features functional. In binary releases, this PR causes the 2 new binaries which are not intended to be called directly by users to be placed in libexec/.\r\n> \r\n\r\nI understand this. I am suggesting that the `bitcoin` binary was defaulted to `on` prematurely. I am also suggesting (as sipa is, I believe), that it's unnecessary to ship `bitcoin-node`, and `bitcoin-gui` for v30, if the primary goal is to allow for the use of sv2. I think shipping the extra binaries at this stage is unnecessarily confusing for little benefit.\r\n\r\nI admit that I am late to this discussion as I have been heads-down elsewhere.\r\n\r\n> I'm trying to parse the rest of your comment but fundmentally it is not clear to me how you are connecting \"Requiring all devs to build (lib)multiprocess or manually turn it off\" to \"build (and ship) a bitcoind with -ipcbind\". I feel like this PR is doing all of the things on your list of things it should do and none of the things on your list of things it shouldn't do.\r\n\r\nI'm agreeing with sipa that it's not strictly necessary to ship \"the multiprocess world\" just yet, when most devs likely have not been building with ipc at all. I would rather see a bitcoind with `-ipcbind` as part of the default build/release for v30. That would allow us to go through the process of requiring the dependency without disrupting much else. To me, that seems ideal.",

This may be somewhat naive, but it doesn't seem that difficult to encourage users that want SV2 to use v30 with IPC enabled, and then open up issues as bugs turn up\n- @marcofleon\n\nYes, this is somewhat naive. We've discussed this more than a few times and the reality is that people just don't build from source. We've been talking to miners for a long time and telling them \"just take Sjors' branch and build it and run that\" and basically getting laughed at. Yes, part of the hesitance of miners to doing that is the \"branch\" part, but a nontrivial part is also just the \"build from source\" step. We're not talking about miners who are software engineers, and even building Bitcoin Core from source is a hurdle we don't want to have to deal with. Ultimately to make mining even slightly decentralized we have to convince miners to overhaul much of the tech stack they rely on as a core part of their business, let alone introduce a number of additional pieces to that stack, any of which being buggy may result in burning energy for nothing in return.",

      "body": "@theuni Thanks for stating your preference. If I am following, you would like to:\r\n\r\n1. Link cap'n proto and libmultiprocess into `bitcoind`  and expose a new `-ipcbind` option there instead of only exposing it through the new `bitcoin` binary.\r\n2.  Revert or partially revert #31375 and stop including the `bitcoin` wrapper binary in releases because its presence would be too confusing.\r\n3. Keep all the changes implemented in this PR which toggle the ENABLE_IPC option.\r\n4. Introduce a new ENABLE_MULTIPROCESS option to toggle building of multiprocess binaries instead of having ENABLE_IPC toggle both IPC and multiprocess features.\r\n5. Not merge this PR until 4 is done because the existence of two new executables in libexec/ would be confusing to users, even though they are not in bin/ and not on the PATH.\r\n\r\nIt seems like you are asking for something well beyond what sipa is asking for. I don't think sipa is complaining about the `bitcoin` utility. I haven't heard anyone complain about the `bitcoin` utility. I also think the changes you are asking for are less conservative than what this PR does because your and sipa's approach would bake IPC features and dependencies into all binaries when their only practical use is for the mining interface.\r\n\r\nI think I have a clear idea of what you want, but I don't yet have a clear idea of why you want it. I don't understand what practical harm you think the current PR has. Pointing out that people may notice and be confused by new files sounds like grounds for organizing and [documenting](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/files.md#installed-files) the files better as done in #31679, not dictating how widely to roll out IPC features. I think we all want to end up in the same place in the long run but I prefer a narrower rollout in the short run which is what has been implemented and discussed in this PR and related PRs and issues over the past years (particularly #30983, #31756, #31098, #28722)",

      "body": "Thanks again for clarifying sipa. I believe adding the `-ipcbind` to `bitcoind` and having separate build flags for IPC and multiprocess features is a reasonable approach and something I want to propose and discuss further in #30983.\r\n\r\nI think we both agree that change could be a followup for a future release and does not need to block the current PR, **but please let me know if I misunderstood and that is not the case, or if you changed your mind about this**.\r\n\r\nI think adding `-ipcbind` to `bitcoind` could be a nice accompaniment to PR's potentially exposing other IPC interfaces like #32297 (RPC interface), #29409 (Chain interface), #32898 (Tracing interface) since it would make these interfaces available to users who just want to use `bitcoind` and are not interested in using `bitcoin`.\r\n\r\nI do think there are some tradeoffs to consider. As mentioned, I would be sad about no longer providing binaries with minimal dependencies. I think that's a nice thing for the project to provide for its users. I would also be sad about having two build options instead of one because I think build options are a maintenance burden in a way runtime options are not (and as I have discussed with hebasto various times, ideally I would want to eliminate all`ENABLE_` build options that control which targets are build, and make cmake only have `WITH_` options controlling which dependencies are used). From a usability perspective, I also like the idea of treating multiprocess and IPC features as a unit. I like the idea that `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` would not be changing in any way, but the `bitcoin` CLI would offer a superset of their functionality and a bunch of new features. It is true that IPC and multiprocess features do not need to be tied together, just as the sqlite and descriptor wallet features do not need to be tied together. But I think in both cases tying them together has the benefit of reducing long term complexity and setting a clear direction for the project.",

This means everyone uses and tests the same binary, isn't forced into adopting the multiprocess approach to use IPC (though they can use `bitcoin` wrapper if they like, which will make a future transition easier, which I very much hope happens - but at a time when multiprocess actually has tangible benefits beyond exposing IPC).\r\n\r\nIf this PR is merged as-is now, and later `-ipcbind` support is added to `bitcoind` too, then we end up in a situation where we're literally shipping two feature-equivalent binaries (`bitcoin-node` and `bitcoind`), unless by that time multiprocess has progressed to a point where `bitcoin-node` has wallet and/or gui split out? That seems pretty silly to me, and loses the benefits I think we can have from not forcing people into using a separate binary/approach just for the one case where they want the mining IPC.\r\n\r\nBut at this point, I'd really like to hear some other opinions beyond yours and @Sjors' (who seem to favor this PR) and @theuni and I (who seem to favor the `bitcoind -ipcbind` approach). If it's just us who hold opinions on the matter, I really don't want to be pushing for this last minute change.",

With the `bitcoin` wrapper binary, there is little cost in dropping the `libexec/` binaries that are unnecessary again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> I feel like I keep pointing out difference between the bin/ and libexec/ directories, and you and Cory keep not seeing the difference between them. \r\n\r\nMy concern is not the fact that there are added binaries, but that we force people to use a different one (`bitcoin-node`, even if it's not visible) if they want the mining IPC but don't care about multiprocess - resulting in them using an approach that isn't tested/looked at/used by anyone else.\r\n\r\nI think the mental load is a factor too (though Cory seems to care more about this), but it is about having to explain to people that they now (in some cases) need `bitcoin -m node` rather than `bitcoind`. The fact that there are more binaries isn't nearly as important as explaining how/when to use them, and why/when they should care about this at all.\r\n\r\nI'm in favor of multiprocess happening when it's ready. We should have a point in time where we decide, as a project, to start moving everything to multiprocess. At that point, there will inevitably be a mental cost to users, but at least it can be explained then as \"this gives you the benefit of process separation, being able to run wallets elsewhere, stop/start gui independently from node, ...\", and it'll be used and tested by all.",

      "body": "> but it is about having to explain to people that they now (in some cases) need bitcoin -m node rather than bitcoind\r\n\r\nOh yes, I completely agree this is not ideal. It should be possible to just specify `ipcbind` on the command line or configuration file and the `bitcoin` command should pick it up and call the right binary without the need for `-m`. A suggested improvement listed in #31375 is:\r\n\r\n>- Better `--multiprocess` (`-m`) / `--monolithic` (`-M`) default selection. Right now, default is monolithic but it probably makes sense to chose more intelligently depending on whether -ipc options are enabled and what binaries are available.\r\n\r\n#31375 was another issue that had a lot of internal debates and discussion so I was a little burned out from making improvements to it after it was merged, but this would be a nice, simple improvement that would be great to add before releasing more IPC features. It seems less important for the stratum v2 feature, but doing this would improve usability, and remove an unnecessary coupling of multiprocess and IPC features as you suggest.",

      "body": "> @theuni Thanks for stating your preference. If I am following, you would like to:\r\n\r\nIt seems (as usual :p) that we're talking past each other.\r\n\r\nAbove, I described what would've been, in my opinion, the ideal features for v30. That would've been a bitcoind with build-time opt-out for IPC. That build-time opt-out would've added `-ipcbind` to bitcoind. It would've been default-on, so that all devs would've encountered IPC as part of their build process, or turned it off manually. By default, there would've been no `bitcoin` util, nor would there have been any multiprocess binaries built by default.\r\n\r\nThat is what would've made sense to me, from a project POV, to ship for v30. That would've been a way to exercise the new IPC functionality (and allow sv2), without encouraging users to move to multiprocess. To me, those are separate concerns, and it would've made sense to do one and then the other. The v31 cycle would've seen the multiprocess binaries turned on by default (though potentially `bitcoin-node` wouldn't have been necessary if the functionality were baked into bitcoind). \r\n\r\nBut that's not where we are now. `bitcoin` is currently built by default. Such is life. In my opinion, that was premature because the multiprocess binaries aren't yet, but as @Sjors points out, it has other uses. So, no, I'm not suggesting that we revert it. I mentioned that because I think it helps to explain my opinion as a whole. I'm just trying to be consistent.\r\n\r\n> My concern is not the fact that there are added binaries, but that we force people to use a different one (bitcoin-node, even if it's not visible) if they want the mining IPC but don't care about multiprocess - resulting in them using an approach that isn't tested/looked at/used by anyone else.\r\n> \r\n> I think the mental load is a factor too (though Cory seems to care more about this), but it is about having to explain to people that they now (in some cases) need bitcoin -m node rather than bitcoind. The fact that there are more binaries isn't nearly as important as explaining how/when to use them, and why/when they should care about this at all.\r\n> \r\n> I'm in favor of multiprocess happening when it's ready. We should have a point in time where we decide, as a project, to start moving everything to multiprocess. At that point, there will inevitably be a mental cost to users, but at least it can be explained then as \"this gives you the benefit of process separation, being able to run wallets elsewhere, stop/start gui independently from node, ...\", and it'll be used and tested by all.\r\n\r\nThis sums up my opinion well. I just don't see the rush. There's a demand for sv2, and a low-risk way to ship that with very little fanfare. Multiprocess seems like a different concern.\r\n\r\nWhat's here isn't my preference, but I'm not opposed enough to hold it up. So I'll step out of the conversation.",

We (on this PR) understand the difference between the binaries. We understand the `libexec/` distinction. But thousands of users who download the tarball will not. They'll encounter the old `bitcoind` binary, a new `bitcoin` binary, and a new `bitcoin-node` binary in a weird directory that seems to do the same thing as `bitcoind` if they try to run it.\r\n\r\nThat's fine. They'll encounter `bitcoin` and the binaries in `libexec/` eventually. I just would've preferred that to be accompanied with a more intentional push (and campaign) for multiprocess. For v30, they'll enounter them with little added benefit. ",

We should have a point in time where we decide, as a project, to start moving everything to multiprocess. At that point, there will inevitably be a mental cost to users, but at least it can be explained then as \"this gives you the benefit of process separation, being able to run wallets elsewhere, stop/start gui independently from node, ...\", and it'll be used and tested by all.\r\n> \r\n> This sums up my opinion well. I just don't see the rush. There's a demand for sv2, and a low-risk way to ship that with very little fanfare. Multiprocess seems like a different concern.\r\n\r\nThis is useful feedback, and I think it is actionable. It seems like a PR to make the `bitcoin -m` flag optional when using `-ipcbind` or maybe dropping the `-m` flag entirely would solve this issue? I understand this would not satisfy other expressed preferences, but if you look at the current code (with or without this PR) I think the only thing tying the ipc and process separation features together is the `bitcoin -m` flag.",

Note there is also a `test_bitcoin` binary in the `libexec/` directory and a [readme](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md) file in the root directory to help orient users. We could rename the binaries to have a suffix like `-ipc` or `-internal` if that would make things clearer.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, please correct me if I'm wrong. \r\n\r\nIt's not the `libexec` directory that's the issue , it's the `bin` directory ( packaged ), or will the v30 packaged also contain a libexec directory? \r\n\r\nCurrently, if one would download it from the website the packaged release,  it contains a `bin` with \r\n- bitcoin-cli\r\n- bitcoin-qt\r\n- bitcoin-tx\r\n- bitcoin-util\r\n- bitcoin-wallet\r\n- bitcoind\r\n- test_bitcoin\r\n\r\nAfter this PR how would this look? a `bin` directory with\r\n- bitcoin-cli\r\n- bitcoin-qt\r\n- bitcoin-tx\r\n- bitcoin-util\r\n- bitcoin-wallet\r\n- bitcoind\r\n- test_bitcoin \r\nAND \r\n- bitcoin\r\n- bitcoin-node\r\n\r\n(Which I have to agree to that this is confusing) \r\n\r\nAre you suggesting that the last 2 (in this case) would get the suffix -internal or -ipc ? Will the outcome than be that the bin directory (packaged) look like this: \r\n- bitcoin-cli\r\n- bitcoin-qt\r\n- bitcoin-tx\r\n- bitcoin-util\r\n- bitcoin-wallet\r\n- bitcoind\r\n- test_bitcoin \r\n- bitcoin-internal\r\n- bitcoin-node-internal ",

That would be a pretty annoying situation to be in after @ryanofsky has been working on multiprocess for something like 5-10 years now and @Sjors has been trying to push for better job output from Core for at least a few years now as well.",

Novices will run Umbrel or something, shielding them from this change. \r\n\r\nMaybe I'm underestimating the risk but I see a clear fallback path and more options for miners and the future. I also agree with not adding extra build options, that will complicate a complicated project even more. \r\nTherefor my ACK for this PR. \r\n\r\n(Also thanks for answering my previous questions) ",

We should have a point in time where we decide, as a project, to start moving everything to multiprocess. At that point, there will inevitably be a mental cost to users, but at least it can be explained then as \"this gives you the benefit of process separation, being able to run wallets elsewhere, stop/start gui independently from node, ...\", and it'll be used and tested by all.\r\n> \r\n> This sums up my opinion well. I just don't see the rush. There's a demand for sv2, and a low-risk way to ship that with very little fanfare. Multiprocess seems like a different concern.\r\n\r\nI opened #33229 to avoid the need for users to know anything about multiprocess or reference it in any way. With that PR, users can simply add the `-ipcbind` option to the `bitcoin` command line, or add it to their `bitcoin.conf` file and it will be respected without also adding `-m`. \r\n\r\nIt was always annoying to have to type `-m` and I'd planned to make it optional, but your point that `-m` was referencing an implementation detail and set of features broader than IPC is a reason to drop it sooner.\r\n\r\nWith #33229 , the `-ipcbind` option will still be rejected by `bitcoind` and only accepted by `bitcoin node`. So users will still see there is a new binary with some new features that are a superset of `bitcoind` features. If we want to `bitcoind` to accept `-ipcbind` too, that would be possible as mentioned and come with the upsides and downsides already discussed.",

      "body": "> ### RFM?\r\n\r\nI've been keeping my [review summary](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31802#issuecomment-3200849464) comment up to date through this discussion and I am more confident this is ready to merge now, and plan to do this shortly. \r\n\r\nI've just added the following new sections since my last update:\r\n\r\n>### Review\r\n>- janb84: current ack, high level review with questions and considerations of tradeoffs\r\n\r\n> ### Concerns\r\n> #### conflation of different multiprocess features\r\n> \r\n>* sipa and theuni pointed out it is bad to require users to explicitly use _multiprocess_ flags or binaries just to use `-ipcbind`, because it confuses separate _IPC listening_ and _process separation_ features which are both enabled by the _multiprocess_ dependency.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n>* ryanofsky agrees and thinks [multiprocess: Don't require bitcoin -m argument when IPC options are used #33229](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33229) would solve this by making the `bitcoin -m` option optional, since the `-m` option is the only place the _multiprocess_ term should be currently visible to users.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> #### user confusion from new files\r\n> \r\n>* theuni pointed out presence of the new `bin/bitcoin` file (already added in master) and `libexec/bitcoin-node` and `libexec/bitcoin-gui` files (added by this PR) in binary releases could cause confusion for users\r\n> \r\n>* ryanofsky pointed out the the effects of this should be mitigated by the [readme](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/README.md) file located in the root directory, and general familiarity with the convention of putting user-facing binaries `bin/` but more documentation or different naming might solve potential problems",

Would maybe say \"`NO_IPC`: don't build Cap’n Proto and libmultiprocess packages, and disable building IPC binaries (`bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-gui`)\"\r\n\r\nAlso, since this is the most significant commit in the PR, which controls whether IPC binaries are included in releases, it would be good to mention the effect this has on releases in the commit description.\r\n\r\nCommit description could also mention effect this has on CI builds: it cause more depends builds to build IPC binaries, but still the only build running functional tests with them is the `i686_multiprocess` one.",

I think all that might be needed there is a paragraph mentioning that the new `bitcoin` command has a *multiprocess* `-m` option enabling features which allow separate processes to communicate with each other. The only feature currently enabled by `-m` is an `-ipcbind` option allowing external tools to connect to the node and efficiently generate block templates for mining. But in the future `-m` may also allow different Bitcoin Core components (such as the wallet, node, and gui) to run in separate processes and be managed independently. The `-m` option might also be enabled by default in a future release.",

The MATCHES checks are treating values like \"@zmq_packages@\" \"@wallet_packages@\" as false if they are empty strings or if they are \"strings containing only spaces\" since apparently such values are treated as false by make & depends.\r\n\r\nThe check here is doing the same thing but it's just implemented in a different way. If `@ipc_packages@` contains spaces, cmake will ignore them and the ${ipc_packages} variable will be empty.\r\n\r\nThis seems potentially cleaner than doing a regex match, though I'm not sure what style is better. Either way the behavior should be ok",

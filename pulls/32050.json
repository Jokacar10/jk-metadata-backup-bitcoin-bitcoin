    "body": "In the functional test framework we currently have a strong tendency to treat and store identifiers that result from hash functions (e.g. (w)txids, block hashes) as integers, which seems an unnatural and confusing choice. Hashes are just pseudo-random sequences of bytes, and there is usually no need to apply integer operations on them; the only exceptions I could think of is PoW-verification of block hashes with the less-than (`<`) operator, or interpreting the byte-string as scalar in the EC-context for e.g. key derivation.\r\n\r\nI'd hence argue that most uses of `ser_uint256`/`uint256_from_str` and txid conversions via `int(txid/blockhash, 16)` are potential code smells and should be reduced to a minimum long-term if possible. This PR is a first step into this direction, intentionally kept small with (what I think) uncontroversial changes for demonstration purposes, to check out if other contributors are interested in this. A next step could be to change the classes of primitives (CTransaction, CBlock etc.) and network messages (msg_) to store hash results as actual bytes (maybe in a class wrapping the bytes that offers conversion from/to human-readable strings [1], for easier interaction with RPC calls and debug outputs) rather than ints. But that would of course need larger, potentially more controversial changes, and its questionable if its really worth the effort.\r\n\r\n[1] unfortunately, txids and block hashes are shown to user in reverse byte order, so e.g. a txid_bytes->txid_str conversion is not just a simple `txid_bytes.hex()`, but a `txid_bytes[::-1].hex()`",

Would be better to say something like converting hashes to numbers is usually not necessary, so it is better to avoid doing it when not needed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I don't think it matters too much which approach is taken, and this code change does seem to remove some blob > number > blob round trips, which is nice.\r\n\r\nMy only concern would be that this PR is labeled \"part 1\" so I'd be worried about how many more parts there will be and whether code will be in left in a confusing intermediate state while it's being converted from one approach to the other.",

Some portion of the language can also be altered in the description like suggested in the comment if the author agrees.",

      "body": "@ryanofsky @rkrux: Thanks for the feedback! Removed the \"(part 1)\" from the PR title as suggested and adapted the strong \"almost never makes sense\" wording in the description. I agree that displaying hash results as byte-reversed hex is an arbitrary decision, but one that stems from the Satoshi-era past and all Bitcoin protocol software that deals with user interface follows it (see also https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/116730/why-does-bitcoin-core-print-sha256-hashes-uint256-bytes-in-reverse-order).\r\n\r\n> Status quo where hashes are simply interpreted as little endian numbers, and those numbers are represented as hex strings in the standard way python and other software represents numbers represented as strings makes more sense conceptually and technically, IMO.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't agree to that statement, especially the \"simply\" part. For starters, many programming languages don't even offer support for larger numbers in the standard library, and it seems unnecessary to artificially involve an additional data type in the hash -> string conversion chain if that type is not even used for what it's intended to. Note that the changes proposed in this PR have been done for the main codebase already more than ten years ago: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5490 (even though arguably, the name `uint256` might still suggest otherwise). For the few cases where treating a hash as an integer does indeed make sense, an explicit type `arith_uint256` has been introduced.\r\n\r\n> My only concern would be that this PR is labeled \"part 1\" so I'd be worried about how many more parts there will be and whether code will be in left in a confusing intermediate state while it's being converted from one approach to the other.\r\n\r\nFair point, I agree that we shouldn't end up in an intermediate state. But these worries can be expressed in upcoming PRs that might create such a state (if there is any); whether there will be additional PRs or not is obviously not so much dependend on the title of a PR, but on whether other contributors signal interest in follow-ups (one has been expressed e.g. in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32050#discussion_r1993286997).\r\n\r\n",

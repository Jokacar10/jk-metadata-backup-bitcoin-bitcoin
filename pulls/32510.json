    "body": "We currently store rejected mempool transactions in the extra pool. This includes (some) policy and consensus rejected transactions.\r\n\r\nIt seems trivial to attack this pool for free with consensus invalid transactions, or almost free with policy violating transactions that are extremely unlikely to ever get mined. This was known at the time it was introduced: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9499#discussion_r96489548\r\n\r\nAt the same time the orphanage already handles some cases that were initially dealt with here.\r\n\r\nThis commit simplifies things by only putting replaced transactions in the extra pool, as these represent things that at least previously passed our mempool DoS protections.\r\n\r\nLater on we could introduce similar DoS protection as #31829 does for the orphan pool, and then expand the list of things we store again. Or even revert to the present behavior.\r\n\r\nThis extra pool was introduced by #9499. It started with just adding replaced transactions in commit 93380c5247526e2248248a7d539233ec48d11bdd, added orphans in 7f8c8cab1e537809848088d3bfaa13ecca7ac8cc and then all the other rejected things in 863edb45b9841c3058e883015c7576e6f69e3cc6.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- restore some lost test coverage\r\n- consider bringing some reject reasons back to this pool",

Still, then I'd take that as motivation to add smarter protections.\r\n\r\nGiven the concerns expressed by many recently about \"filtering\" slowing down block propagation, this PR sounds like a step backward to me. I am always interested in seeing B10C's research, of course, if it exists. But FWIW here are the stats from the most recent block (896843, which doesn't look especially spammy) on a Knots node (same logic for this functionality, AFAIK) with `blockreconstructionextratxn=10000` and moderately-aggressive filtering:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2025-05-15T15:20:14Z [cmpctblock] Successfully reconstructed block 000000000000000000021ff7cef215cf12815880bf031fdb44d14636fd7a1272 with 1 txn prefilled, 3594 txn from mempool (incl at least 87 from extra pool) and 32 txn requested\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems like including things that are rejected for policy reasons is useful.",

If they were all RBF replacements, then this PR wouldn't hurt that. If they're all inscriptions, then it would.\r\n\r\n> Seems like including things that are rejected for policy reasons is useful.\r\n\r\nIn principle yes. The problem is that when we decide a transaction is invalid for _policy_ reasons, we don't recheck it against _consensus_. We don't know the difference. So we hold on to consensus invalid transactions, which means anyone can connect to your node, feed it 100kb worth or garbage and then disconnect.\r\n\r\nThings would be different if we _did_ check whether something is only policy invalid, but that would eat extra CPU cycles.\r\n\r\n@glozow wrote:\r\n\r\n> is a bit like giving up on orphan resolution because the orphanage is trivially DoSable... it seems more productive to try to come up with ways to make it less vulnerable to churn\r\n\r\nYou're working on that for orphan resolution, but nobody is currently working on it for the extra pool. If we can apply the same mechanism, that would probably be a better solution. And perhaps that's really easy.\r\n\r\nIf we can't apply that here, then it seems better to allocate the 100kb towards the most effective and hardest to DoS thing, e.g. by restricting it to fee bumps.\r\n\r\nIn any case I'd love to see @0xB10C's data. I'll keep this in draft.",

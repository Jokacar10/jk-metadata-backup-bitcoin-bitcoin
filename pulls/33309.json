      "diff_hunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,229 @@\n+Bitcoin Core version 29.1 is now available from:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-29.1/>\n+\n+This release includes various bug fixes and performance\n+improvements, as well as updated translations.\n+\n+Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:\n+\n+  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>\n+\n+To receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:\n+\n+  <https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/>\n+\n+How to Upgrade\n+==============\n+\n+If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the\n+Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+### Mempool Policy\n+\n+- The maximum number of potentially executed legacy signature operations in a\n+  single standard transaction is now limited to 2500. Signature operations in all\n+  previous output scripts, in all input scripts, as well as all P2SH redeem\n+  scripts (if there are any) are counted toward the limit. The new limit is\n+  assumed to not affect any known typically formed standard transactions. The\n+  change was done to prepare for a possible BIP54 deployment in the future.\n+\n+- #32521 policy: make pathological transactions packed with legacy sigops non-standard\n+\n+- The minimum block feerate (`-blockmintxfee`) has been changed to 1 satoshi per kvB. It can still be changed using the\n+configuration option.\n+\n+- The default minimum relay feerate (`-minrelaytxfee`) and incremental relay feerate (`-incrementalrelayfee`) have been\n+changed to 100 satoshis per kvB. They can still be changed using their respective configuration options, but it is\n+recommended to change both together if you decide to do so.\n+  - Other minimum feerates (e.g. the dust feerate, the minimum returned by the fee estimator, and all feerates used by\n+  the wallet) remain unchanged. The mempool minimum feerate still changes in response to high volume.\n+  - Note that unless these lower defaults are widely adopted across the network, transactions created with lower fee\n+  rates are not guaranteed to propagate or confirm. The wallet feerates remain unchanged; `-mintxfee` must be changed\n+  before attempting to create transactions with lower feerates using the wallet.\n+\n+- #33106 policy: lower the default blockmintxfee, incrementalrelayfee, minrelaytxfee\n+\n+### Logging\n+\n+Unconditional logging to disk is now rate limited by giving each source location\n+a quota of 1MiB per hour. Unconditional logging is any logging with a log level\n+higher than debug, that is `info`, `warning`, and `error`. All logs will be\n+prefixed with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently\n+being suppressed. (#32604)\n+\n+When `-logsourcelocations` is enabled, the log output now contains the entire\n+function signature instead of just the function name. (#32604)\n+\n+### RPC\n+\n+- The `dumptxoutset` RPC now requires a `type` parameter to be specified. To maintain pre\n+  v29.0 behavior, use the `latest` parameter. Documenting this change was missed in the v29.0\n+  release notes. (#30808)\n+\n+### Updated Settings\n+\n+- The `-maxmempool` and `-dbcache` startup parameters are now capped on\n+  32-bit systems to 500MB and 1GiB respectively.\n+\n+- #32530 node: cap -maxmempool and -dbcache values for 32-bit\n+\n+### Wallet\n+\n+- #31757 wallet: fix crash on double block disconnection\n+- #32553 wallet: Fix logging of wallet version\n+\n+### P2P\n+\n+- #32826 p2p: add more bad ports\n+\n+### Test\n+\n+- #32069 test: fix intermittent failure in wallet_reorgsrestore.py\n+- #32286 test: Handle empty string returned by CLI as None in RPC tests\n+- #32312 test: Fix feature_pruning test after nTime typo fix\n+- #32336 test: Suppress upstream -Wduplicate-decl-specifier in bpfcc\n+- #32463 test: fix an incorrect feature_fee_estimation.py subtest\n+- #32483 test: fix two intermittent failures in wallet_basic.py\n+- #32630 test: fix sync function in rpc_psbt.py\n+- #32765 test: Fix list index out of range error in feature_bip68_sequence.py\n+- #32742 test: fix catchup loop in outbound eviction functional test\n+- #32823 test: Fix wait_for_getheaders() call in test_outbound_eviction_blocks_relay_only()\n+- #32833 test: Add msgtype to msg_generic slots\n+- #32841 feature_taproot: sample tx version border values more\n+- #32850 test: check P2SH sigop count for coinbase tx\n+- #32859 test: correctly detect nonstd TRUC tx vsize in feature_taproot\n+- #33001 test: Do not pass tests on unhandled exceptions\n+\n+### Indexes\n+\n+- #33212 index: Don't commit state in BaseIndex::Rewind\n+\n+### Util\n+\n+- #32248 Remove support for RNDR/RNDRRS for aarch64\n+\n+### Build\n+\n+- #32356 cmake: Respect user-provided configuration-specific flags\n+- #32437 crypto: disable ASan for sha256_sse4 with Clang\n+- #32469 cmake: Allow WITH_DBUS on all Unix-like systems\n+- #32439 guix: accomodate migration to codeberg\n+- #32551 cmake: Add missed SSE41_CXXFLAGS\n+- #32568 depends: use \"mkdir -p\" when installing xproto\n+- #32678 guix: warn and abort when SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set\n+- #32690 depends: fix SHA256SUM command on OpenBSD (use GNU mode output)\n+- #32716 depends: Override host compilers for FreeBSD and OpenBSD\n+- #32760 depends: capnp 1.2.0\n+- #32798 build: add root dir to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in toolchain\n+- #32805 cmake: Use HINTS instead of PATHS in find_* commands\n+- #32814 cmake: Explicitly specify Boost_ROOT for Homebrew's package\n+- #32837 depends: fix libevent _WIN32_WINNT usage\n+- #32943 depends: Force CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY=TRUE\n+- #32954 cmake: Drop no longer necessary \"cmakeMinimumRequired\" object\n+- #33073 guix: warn SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH set in guix-codesign\n+\n+### Gui\n+\n+- #864 Crash fix, disconnect numBlocksChanged() signal during shutdown\n+- #868 Replace stray tfm::format to cerr with qWarning\n+\n+### Doc\n+\n+- #32333 doc: Add missing top-level description to pruneblockchain RPC\n+- #32353 doc: Fix fuzz test_runner.py path\n+- #32389 doc: Fix test_bitcoin path\n+- #32607 rpc: Note in fundrawtransaction doc, fee rate is for package\n+- #32679 doc: update tor docs to use bitcoind binary from path\n+- #32693 depends: fix cmake compatibility error for freetype\n+- #32696 doc: make -DWITH_ZMQ=ON explicit on build-unix.md\n+- #32708 rpc, doc: update listdescriptors RCP help\n+- #32711 doc: add missing packages for BSDs (cmake, gmake, curl) to depends/README.md\n+- #32719 doc, windows: CompanyName \"Bitcoin\" => \"Bitcoin Core project\"\n+- #32776 doc: taproot became always active in v24.0\n+- #32777 doc: fix Transifex 404s\n+- #32846 doc: clarify that the \"-j N\" goes after the \"--build build\" part\n+- #32858 doc: Add workaround for vcpkg issue with paths with embedded spaces\n+- #33070 doc/zmq: fix unix socket path example\n+- #33088 doc: move cmake -B build -LH up in Unix build docs\n+- #33133 rpc: fix getpeerinfo ping duration unit docs\n+- #33119 rpc: Fix 'getdescriptoractivity' RPCHelpMan, add test to verify fix\n+- #33236 doc: Remove wrong and redundant doxygen tag\n+\n+### CI\n+\n+- #32184 ci: Add workaround for vcpkg's libevent package\n+- #33261 ci: return to using dash in CentOS job\n+\n+### Misc\n+\n+- #32187 refactor: Remove spurious virtual from final ~CZMQNotificationInterface\n+- #32454 tracing: fix invalid argument in mempool_monitor\n+- #32771 contrib: tracing: Fix read of pmsg_type in p2p_monitor.py\n+- #33086 contrib: [tracing] fix pointer argument handling in mempool_monitor.py\n+\n+Credits\n+=======\n+\n+Thanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:",

Unconditional logging is any logging with a log level\n+higher than debug, that is `info`, `warning`, and `error`. All logs will be\n+prefixed with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently\n+being suppressed.

Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and tested on operating systems using the\n+Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+### Mempool Policy\n+\n+- The maximum number of potentially executed legacy signature operations in a\n+  single standard transaction is now limited to 2500. Signature operations in all\n+  previous output scripts, in all input scripts, as well as all P2SH redeem\n+  scripts (if there are any) are counted toward the limit. The new limit is\n+  assumed to not affect any known typically formed standard transactions. The\n+  change was done to prepare for a possible BIP54 deployment in the future.\n+\n+- #32521 policy: make pathological transactions packed with legacy sigops non-standard\n+\n+- The minimum block feerate (`-blockmintxfee`) has been changed to 1 satoshi per kvB. It can still be changed using the\n+configuration option.\n+\n+- The default minimum relay feerate (`-minrelaytxfee`) and incremental relay feerate (`-incrementalrelayfee`) have been\n+changed to 100 satoshis per kvB. They can still be changed using their respective configuration options, but it is\n+recommended to change both together if you decide to do so.\n+  - Other minimum feerates (e.g. the dust feerate, the minimum returned by the fee estimator, and all feerates used by\n+  the wallet) remain unchanged. The mempool minimum feerate still changes in response to high volume.\n+  - Note that unless these lower defaults are widely adopted across the network, transactions created with lower fee\n+  rates are not guaranteed to propagate or confirm. The wallet feerates remain unchanged; `-mintxfee` must be changed\n+  before attempting to create transactions with lower feerates using the wallet.\n+\n+- #33106 policy: lower the default blockmintxfee, incrementalrelayfee, minrelaytxfee\n+\n+### Logging\n+\n+Unconditional logging to disk is now rate limited by giving each source location\n+a quota of 1MiB per hour. Unconditional logging is any logging with a log level\n+higher than debug, that is `info`, `warning`, and `error`. All logs will be\n+prefixed with `[*]` if there is at least one source location that is currently\n+being suppressed. (#32604)\n+\n+When `-logsourcelocations` is enabled, the log output now contains the entire\n+function signature instead of just the function name. (#32604)\n+\n+### RPC\n+\n+- The `dumptxoutset` RPC now requires a `type` parameter to be specified. To maintain pre\n+  v29.0 behavior, use the `latest` parameter. Documenting this change was missed in the v29.0\n+  release notes. (#30808)\n+\n+### Updated Settings\n+\n+- The `-maxmempool` and `-dbcache` startup parameters are now capped on\n+  32-bit systems to 500MB and 1GiB respectively.\n+\n+- #32530 node: cap -maxmempool and -dbcache values for 32-bit\n+\n+### Wallet\n+\n+- #31757 wallet: fix crash on double block disconnection\n+- #32553 wallet: Fix logging of wallet version\n+\n+### P2P\n+\n+- #32826 p2p: add more bad ports\n+\n+### Test\n+\n+- #32069 test: fix intermittent failure in wallet_reorgsrestore.py\n+- #32286 test: Handle empty string returned by CLI as None in RPC tests\n+- #32312 test: Fix feature_pruning test after nTime typo fix\n+- #32336 test: Suppress upstream -Wduplicate-decl-specifier in bpfcc\n+- #32463 test: fix an incorrect feature_fee_estimation.py subtest\n+- #32483 test: fix two intermittent failures in wallet_basic.py\n+- #32630 test: fix sync function in rpc_psbt.py\n+- #32765 test: Fix list index out of range error in feature_bip68_sequence.py\n+- #32742 test: fix catchup loop in outbound eviction functional test\n+- #32823 test: Fix wait_for_getheaders() call in test_outbound_eviction_blocks_relay_only()\n+- #32833 test: Add msgtype to msg_generic slots\n+- #32841 feature_taproot: sample tx version border values more\n+- #32850 test: check P2SH sigop count for coinbase tx\n+- #32859 test: correctly detect nonstd TRUC tx vsize in feature_taproot\n+- #33001 test: Do not pass tests on unhandled exceptions\n+\n+### Indexes\n+\n+- #33212 index: Don't commit state in BaseIndex::Rewind\n+\n+### Util\n+\n+- #32248 Remove support for RNDR/RNDRRS for aarch64\n+\n+### Build\n+\n+- #32356 cmake: Respect user-provided configuration-specific flags\n+- #32437 crypto: disable ASan for sha256_sse4 with Clang\n+- #32469 cmake: Allow WITH_DBUS on all Unix-like systems\n+- #32439 guix: accomodate migration to codeberg\n+- #32551 cmake: Add missed SSE41_CXXFLAGS\n+- #32568 depends: use \"mkdir -p\" when installing xproto\n+- #32678 guix: warn and abort when SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set\n+- #32690 depends: fix SHA256SUM command on OpenBSD (use GNU mode output)\n+- #32716 depends: Override host compilers for FreeBSD and OpenBSD\n+- #32760 depends: capnp 1.2.0\n+- #32798 build: add root dir to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in toolchain\n+- #32805 cmake: Use HINTS instead of PATHS in find_* commands\n+- #32814 cmake: Explicitly specify Boost_ROOT for Homebrew's package\n+- #32837 depends: fix libevent _WIN32_WINNT usage\n+- #32943 depends: Force CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY=TRUE\n+- #32954 cmake: Drop no longer necessary \"cmakeMinimumRequired\" object\n+- #33073 guix: warn SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH set in guix-codesign\n+\n+### Gui\n+\n+- #864 Crash fix, disconnect numBlocksChanged() signal during shutdown\n+- #868 Replace stray tfm::format to cerr with qWarning\n+\n+### Doc\n+\n+- #32333 doc: Add missing top-level description to pruneblockchain RPC\n+- #32353 doc: Fix fuzz test_runner.py path\n+- #32389 doc: Fix test_bitcoin path\n+- #32607 rpc: Note in fundrawtransaction doc, fee rate is for package\n+- #32679 doc: update tor docs to use bitcoind binary from path\n+- #32693 depends: fix cmake compatibility error for freetype\n+- #32696 doc: make -DWITH_ZMQ=ON explicit on build-unix.md\n+- #32708 rpc, doc: update listdescriptors RCP help",

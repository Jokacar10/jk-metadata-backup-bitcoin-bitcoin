    "body": "**Motivation**\r\nThe default relay-fee (-minrelaytxfee) was set to 1000 sat/kvB about [10 years ago](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/9e93640be6c49fa1505ba5c5df8c89210da5a6e4). Over that period the USD price of BTC has risen by roughly 2-3 orders of magnitude, making the economic cost of relaying small transactions disproportionately high. \r\n\r\n**Proposed change**\r\nLower the default to 100 sat/kvB—a 10× reduction—bringing the effective USD cost back in line. This maintains DoS resistance without discouraging low-value UTXO consolidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> Over that period the USD price of BTC has risen by roughly 2-3 orders of magnitude, making the economic cost of relaying small transactions disproportionately high.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether DoS protection back then was actually sufficient, or if the increase in fiat terms was the luck we needed. I don't know the answer to that.\r\n\r\nAs an example, a recent [DoS fix](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/10/08/disclose-large-inv-to-send/) involved a rate limiting mechanism that was set to 7 transactions per second. This rate limit is based on how many transactions fit in a block. It seems plausible, but I don't know, if a lower relay fee would have made it cheaper to DoS nodes before v25.0. It'd be interesting to simulate that with [Warnet](https://warnet.dev).\r\n\r\nAnother difference between now and back then is the presence of Lightning and other systems that are sensitive to mempool shenanigans in general. Again I don't know if those attacks scale with the minimum relay fee either.\r\n\r\nIf that research has already been done, please link to it. Otherwise I would not be in favor (although we may not have a choice if the full-RBF game is repeated).\r\n\r\nFinally in terms of pure node performance, it might be better to wait for cluster mempool #30289 to be deployed.",

Otherwise nodes become subject to free relay attacks that could be used to waste bandwidth across the network with transactions that are not even in danger of getting mined in most blocks.\n\n> `DEFAULT_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE` should be decreased along with this as well.\n\nThat’s probably a bad idea, as it would increase the surface for bandwidth wasting attacks 10× even on top of what dropping the `DEFAULT_MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE` would do.\n\nWhile I’m sympathetic to users wanting to transact (and especially consolidate) at lower feerates whenever blockspace demand is as low as it currently is, this drops a full block’s minimum transaction fees to ~100,000 sats, or about ~0.03% of the current subsidy. That seems like the wrong signal when the ecosystem’s long-term roadmap relies on transaction fees eventually funding mining.\n\nIf this idea gets traction, perhaps it would be interesting to combine a reduction of the minimum relay transaction fee rate with shifting the denomination of fee rates to sats/WU and setting a new minimum relay transaction fee rate to 100 sats/kWU instead which would be 0.4 sats/vB rather than 0.1 sats/vB.",

As of now, nothing breaks which is concerning.\r\n\r\nOn the meta level: Very low feerate transactions have negligible impact on mining profitability in terms of block templates themselves.  It's not obvious that the price going up 10x means we get to lower the default by 10x, because it's a more important system now and the stakes are simply higher. The most persuasive argument for  this would be that miners have diverged from defaults and it is impacting block relay and the DoS risk of 10x lower fees is acceptable. Note that under transactional load(which is what we need long term anyways for consensus stability), this change is a no-op, so I'm not convinced at all this is the right tradeoff.\r\n",

I then shared a [PR](https://github.com/RobinLinus/bitcoin/pull/1) to robin's repo which was squash commited and force pushed here, so each commit would pass the test.

A 0.1sat/vB tx is still rejected.\r\n\r\nI agree the dust feerate is largely orthogonal, but the other minimum feerates are tied, hence autocorrection in mempool_args:\r\n\r\nThe incremental relay feerate, at least for RBF rule 4, should be the same as minrelaytxfee, since they represent the \"price of bandwidth per vb\" for transaction relay. Arguably we should price bandwidth for relaying the replacements as the same as the original. I haven't thought much about what it would look like to use evicted+0.1sat/vB for setting mempoolminfee, but probably good to write up an argument for why that's fine.\r\n\r\nAlso, `-blockmintxfee` should never be higher than `-minrelaytxfee`, as it would cause you to accept and relay transactions that you would never mine.",

That seems like the wrong signal when the ecosystem’s long-term roadmap relies on transaction fees eventually funding mining.\r\n> \r\n> If this idea gets traction, perhaps it would be interesting to combine a reduction of the minimum relay transaction fee rate with shifting the denomination of fee rates to sats/WU and setting a new minimum relay transaction fee rate to 100 sats/kWU instead which would be 0.4 sats/vB rather than 0.1 sats/vB.\r\n\r\nSo why not increase it to 10 sats/vB—reducing bandwidth consumption by 10×, making the network 10× more resilient to spam, and sending the right economic signal for long-term sustainability?\r\nI understand the opinion of some core devs, but you can't force people to pay higher fees unless it's a consensus rule.

Better have a conservative value that is resistant to an asset price decrease than an optimistic value that tries to captivate very low fees in times of high asset prices and low usage.\r\n\r\nI am not against lowering the minrelay value, especially if it is shown that there is sustained usage of sub-1sat/vb transactions that get included by miners. But i agree with @instagibbs that this is a non-trivial change for little gains and the onus is on the supporters of the change.\r\n\r\nAlso, i don't think there is a good reason for decreasing the incremental relay fee at the same time as the min relay fee.",

We currently have 20% of hashrate now mining sub 1 sat/vbyte ([source](https://x.com/mononautical/status/1944942585384198259)) and some mining pools are leaving revenue on the table due to not having the right mempool policy ([source](https://x.com/mononautical/status/1945328731821892043)), couldn't the argument be made that some mining pools are being advantaged by using the default values?\r\n\r\nA fair counter point is, this explicit change by definition is over a de minimis amount of revenue (1.8 million sats in fee revenue in a full block on the high end). Maybe it is ok to leave some money on the table by running defaults, because a high demand of this transaction type would never result in a material amount of missed revenue?",

      "body": ">your assessment that \"default relay policy for Core essentially controls what ends up in the blockchain and what doesn't\" is obviously falsified.\r\n\r\nIt obviously remains true, you're just cherry picking. Again, the vast, overwhelming, super-super majority of what you see in the chain is what nodes will typically relay due to whatever Core's defaults are.\r\n\r\nThis is not an \"overly general\" statement, it's a fact that - I'm sorry to have to point out - is being ignored because that is convenient for the recent agenda to keep removing filters along with the justification that they \"don't do anything\" when they clearly do.\r\n\r\nA contrived scenario in which a whole bunch of transactions start hitting the chain which violate a default a Core filter is not conclusive proof otherwise.

      "body": "When I evaluated why the test was failing, I noticed that changing the value for `NORMAL_FEE_FILTER` on its own was insufficient for making the test pass. Digging further into the mechanics on how the policy filters worked, and looking logs on my local version of the code this is what I found:\r\n\r\nI made the change from `9170997` to `9936506` because,  reducing minrelaytxfee halves min_fee_limit (500→50, [fees.cpp:1090](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/184159e4f30c6846cd0324ee07b59e7f8121a5ea/src/policy/fees.cpp#L1091)). This alters the geometric sequence in MakeFeeSet (fees.cpp:1092-1095).\r\n\r\nWith spacing=1.1 (set in [fees.h:322)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/184159e4f30c6846cd0324ee07b59e7f8121a5ea/src/policy/fees.h#L322), starting lower fits one more bucket before capping at 1e7, yielding a higher max (`9936506`) due to floating point multiplication. \r\n\r\nThis can be verified independently if you run [FeeFilterRounder](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/184159e4f30c6846cd0324ee07b59e7f8121a5ea/src/policy/fees.cpp#L1101) with CFeeRate(100) vs CFeeRate(1000), and call round(MAX_MONEY).\r\n\r\nTo @instagibbs's point, if the better approach is write a new set of tests instead of working with the poorly written tests we have now, happy to help when I have time.",

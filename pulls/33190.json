    "body": "This change toggles `-DENABLE_IPC` default value from `OFF` to `ON` so IPC features will be compiled by default in source builds.\r\n\r\nThe main feature this provides is an [`-ipcbind`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8405fdb06e8ff3220590bfac84e98547067ec6b7/src/init.cpp#L685) option that lets the node listen on a unix socket and expose a [mining interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8405fdb06e8ff3220590bfac84e98547067ec6b7/src/interfaces/mining.h#L77-L135) to support Stratum v2 mining software.\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't affect `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt` since IPC features are implemented in separate binaries accessible through a new [`bitcoin`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8405fdb06e8ff3220590bfac84e98547067ec6b7/doc/release-notes-31375-31679.md) command.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is a minimal change that just enables IPC by default in cmake. #31802 is more comprehensive and additionally enables IPC by default in depends, uses it in more CI jobs, and updates documentation. If you like this PR, you will love #31802!\r\n\r\nI prefer the approach in #31802 of enabling IPC in source builds, release binaries, and CI at the same time, without an intermediate state where source and binary releases are different. But there was a comment in todays [irc meeting](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2025-08-14.html#l-239) \"i think it'd be nice if we had IPC enabled in from-source builds by default for a while before we add it to releases\" and there have been similar comments previously, so maybe this PR will be of interest if we want to take that approach.",

      "body": "I want to elaborate on why I prefer #31802 to this change.\r\n\r\nThe idea of enabling IPC in source builds before binary releases sounds nice at first, but more thought, stops really making sense.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, this is not how we've rolled out any other features I'm aware of. Most features aren't toggled by build flags, but theoretically any new feature could be gated by a build flag, enabled first in source builds, and later in binary releases. We don't roll out features this way because it's cumbersome and offers no clear benefits. I don't think IPC is different from other features in this respect. Even looking at the last feature that was toggled by a build flag, SQLite, there was never a point where it was enabled in source builds but disabled in depends and binary releases (see #19077).\r\n\r\nI think some people like the idea of turning IPC on in source builds but leaving it off in depends and binary releases because they think it would lead to more feature testing before inclusion in a binary release. But IPC has already been enabled in the \"dev-mode\" CMake preset for as long as that preset has existed. And since the only real functionality added by ENABLE_IPC is the third-party mining interface, I doubt changing its default will meaningfully increase testing, unless there's a user or developer who (1) is willing to write or download a program that connects to the interface, (2) builds Bitcoin Core from source with default CMake options, but (3) is unwilling to manually enable ENABLE_IPC. That seems like a narrow group.\r\n\r\nThe only possible benefit I see from changing the default to ON in source builds is that it would confirm IPC builds and tests work on more platforms and with a wider variety of build options beyond what CI covers. That has some value, but I don't see build flag compatibility or platform-specific bugs as major concerns, so putting the feature in a half-enabled state just to get a few more builds and automated tests doesn't seem appealing.\r\n\r\nI have no objection to this change if it helps us move forward. I just want to explain why I don't think it's very useful on its own, and why I dropped it from #31741 after initially implementing it there.",

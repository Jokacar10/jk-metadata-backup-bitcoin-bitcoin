PR adds 2 test cases , trying to upgrade from the latest version and asserting it stays the same and trying to downgrade from the latest version. Test case to actually upgrade is not possible currently since the `createwallet` rpc by default creates wallet with version `FEATURE_LATEST` which is the highest.",

PR adds 2 test cases , trying to upgrade from the latest version and asserting it stays the same and trying to downgrade from the latest version. Test case to actually upgrade is not possible currently since the `createwallet` rpc by default creates wallet with version `FEATURE_LATEST` which is the highest.",

I am not very sure about what the future plans are for wallet but the only case where I see this being used is if there is a need to upgradewallet version to `quantum-compatible` wallets. Other than that I see no future use case of the rpc in the near future. ",

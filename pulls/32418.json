    "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a new RPC command called `clearmempool`. It is designed to remove all tranasctions from the mempool (including those from invalidated blocks), and return their TXIDs.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this command is to clear the mempool, then use the returned TXIDs to perform additional cleanup.\r\n\r\nWhen used in combination with `invalidateblock`, it allows me to roll-back the chain to a particular height, clear the mempool, then properly clean up wallets with `abandontransaction`.\r\n\r\nNote that this command does not prevent the transactions from being re-inserted back into the mempool, either through mempool.dat or user wallets. You have to perform additional cleanup to make sure your changes persist.\r\n\r\nI restricted this command to regtest mode as I only need it for running tests, but it could work in any mode.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nMy rationale for adding this command is that I need the ability to cleanly rollback the chain and wallets during testing, and I kept running into the following roadblock:\r\n\r\n* `invalidateblock` will rollback the chain height, but all the transactions are dumped into the mempool, creating spending conflicts with the wallets.\r\n\r\n* You can prevent this dump from happening, most notably with `-walletbroadcast=0`, however that just hides the problem.\r\n\r\n* The real issue is that wallets are still tracking these transactions, and you need to pull their TXIDs from the mempool to properly purge them with `abandontransaction`.\r\n\r\n* But if the transactions are in the mempool, then `abandontransaction` will fail, which puts you in a catch-22 situation.\r\n\r\n`clearmempool` allows you to clear the mempool *and* capture a list of these transactions, so that you can perform the proper cleanup with `abandontransaction`.",

      "message": "rpc: add `clearmempool` command for regtest\n\nThis commit adds a new RPC command called `clearmempool`. It is designed to remove all tranasctions from the mempool (including those from invalidated blocks), and return their TXIDs.\n\nThe purpose of this command is to clear the mempool, then iterate over the returned TXIDs to perform additional cleanup.\n\nWhen used in combination with `invalidateblock`, it allows me to roll-back the chain to a particular height, clear the mempool, then properly clean up wallets with `abandontransaction`.\n\nNote that this command does not prevent the transactions from being re-inserted back into the mempool, either through mempool.dat or user wallets. You have to perform additional cleanup to make sure your changes persist.\n\nI restricted this command to regtest mode as I only need it for running tests, but it could work in any mode.",

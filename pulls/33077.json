    "body": "Currently, consuming `libbitcoinkernel.a` requires all its dependency static libraries to be available. A switch to a monolithic variant, which contains object files from its dependencies, was discussed in the Kernel WG. The necessary preparations in the libsecp256k1 build scripts were completed in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1678, which are now available in this repository since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33036.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR were picked from https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commits/static_kernel/, with an additional adjustment in `libbitcoinkernel.pc.in`.\r\n\r\nThis PR can be tested as described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30814#issue-2505698234.\r\n",

If `.pc` files are not expressive enough for exporting all our target properies (and they will never be, because `.pc` files are not relocatable), we should stop providing them and export target information as CMake packages only. If CMake packages are not expressive enough either, because we don't want to export dependencies in case of a static library, we should simply not export a static library to a package at all. This would still allow clients to to use the static library if they build it as a subproject. They will want to do that anyway, because they want to make sure that their static libraries are built with the same toolchain and compile flags.\r\n\r\nExamples for exporting, importing, as well as using subprojects can be found in https://habla.news/u/purplekarrot.net/cmake-import-export\r\n\r\nCurrently, when clients want to use bitcoin as a suproject, they get their build-type and compile flags silently changed, and they get a summary spewed into their configure log.

If we try to, people will find worse ways to get around this limitation, e.g. by manually picking source files out of the repository and creating the library that way (which they did for libbitcoinconsensus). That said, releasing a shared library through our process would still be nice to have. As you say there is a relocation issue with pkgconfig, and in experimenting with it over the past twelve months I also found it a surprisingly inconsistent tool between platforms. Would be nice if we could get rid of it for something sane. I originally added the pkgconfig file when we were still on autotools.\r\n\r\nHowever it is more convenient in the case of compiling from source to just link a single static object instead of a potentially changing list of them. That's all this change does. FWIW I don't think we should ship a static library as part of a release. Having an install target for it nonetheless could still make it a little more convenient for projects compiling from source.",

I thought you might have been objecting to having code in the build system that generates .pc files. But I agree distributing .pc files with precompiled static libraries does not seem like it would be very useful, and I assume most developers would just compile from source. Would be interested to know more if this is incorrect and anyone is asking for static binaries or would find them useful.\r\n\r\nI am unsure about the relationship between that issue and this PR. This PR seems to want to install a single kernel library instead of a public kernel library and a few private ones it depends on. I can see why you might not like that change because it would not be compatible with the dependency injection described in your blog post. But the PR is only dropping code that was specific to .pc files, so I think as a practical matter this PR would not actually make it harder to support dependency injection if we exported cmake config files in the future?\r\n\r\n(On the other side, I'm also not sure about the benefits of this PR. PR description links to a lot of issues and might be clearer if it just described the problem it solves, or explained if the main movitation is simplifying cmake code or reducing the number of installed files or something else.)",

PR description links to a lot of issues and might be clearer if it just described the problem it solves, or explained if the main movitation is simplifying cmake code or reducing the number of installed files or something else.)\r\n\r\nAt a high level, this simply encapsulates the kernel library. The shared lib already works this way, this PR would just align the static lib's behavior. The other dependencies (crypto, leveldb, secp, etc) are implementation details and are of no interest to the builder. \r\n\r\nIf the internal library details _are_ of interest to the builder, they're likely misusing the kernel. For example, in the past distros (gentoo for ex) have wanted to link against a system leveldb. This change makes it clear that that is unsupported, and prevents users from doing so without hacking the buildsystem.",

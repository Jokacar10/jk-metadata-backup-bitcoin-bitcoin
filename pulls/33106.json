    "body": "ML post for discussion about the general concept, how this impacts the wider ecosystem, philosophy about minimum feerates, etc: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/changing-the-minimum-relay-feerate/1886\r\n\r\nThis PR is inspired by #13922 and #32959 to lower the minimum relay feerate in response to bitcoin's exchange rate changes in the last ~10 years. It lowers the default `-minrelaytxfee` and `-incrementalrelayfee`, and knocks `-blockmintxfee` down to the minimum nonzero setting. Also adds some tests for the settings and pulls in #32750.\r\n\r\nThe minimum relay feerate is a DoS protection rule, representing a price on the network bandwidth used to relay transactions that have no PoW. While relay nodes don't all collect fees, the assumption is that if nodes on the network use their resources to relay this transaction, it will reach a miner and the attacker's money will be spent once it is mined. The incremental relay feerate is similar: it's used to price the relay of replacement transactions (the additional fees need to cover the new transactions at this feerate) and evicted transactions (following a trim, the new mempool minimum feerate is the package feerate of what was removed + incremental).\r\n\r\nAlso note that many nodes on the network have elected to relay/mine lower feerate transactions. Miners (some say up to 85%) are choosing to mine these low feerate transactions instead of leaving block space unfilled, but these blocks have extremely poor compact block reconstruction rates with nodes that rejected or didn't hear about those transactions earlier.\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106#issuecomment-3155627414\r\n- https://x.com/caesrcd/status/1947022514267230302\r\n- https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000001305770e0aa279dcd8ba8be18c3d5cf736a26f77e06fd\r\n- https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000001b491649ec030aa8e003e1f4f9d3b24bb99ba16f91e97\r\n- https://x.com/mononautical/status/1949452586391855121\r\n\r\nWhile it wouldn't make sense to loosen DoS restrictions recklessly in response to these events, I think the current price is higher than necessary, and this motivates us changing the default soon. Since the minimum relay feerate defines an amount as too small based on what it costs the attacker, it makes sense to consider BTC's conversion rate to what resources you can buy in the \"real world.\"\r\n\r\nGoing off of [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32959#issuecomment-3095260286) and [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106#issuecomment-3142444090)\r\n- Let's say an attacker wants to use/exhaust the network's bandwidth, and has the choice between renting resources from a commercial provider and getting the network to \"spam\" itself it by sending unconfirmed transactions. We'd like the latter to be more expensive than the former.\r\n- The bandwidth for relaying a transaction across the network is roughly its serialized size (plus relay overhead) x number of nodes. A 1000vB transaction is 1000-4000B serialized. With 100k nodes, that's 0.1-0.4GB\r\n- If the going rate for ec2 bandwidth is 10c/GB, that's like 1-4c per kvB of transaction data\r\n- Then a 1000vB transaction should pay at least 4c\r\n- $0.04 USD is 40 satoshis at 100k USD/BTC\r\n- Baking in some margin for changes in USD/BTC conversion rate, number of nodes (and thus bandwidth), and commercial service costs, I think 50-100 satoshis is on the conservative end but in the right ballpark\r\n- At least 97% of the recent sub-1sat/vB transactions would be accepted with a new threshold of 0.1sat/vB: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106#issuecomment-3156213089\r\n\r\nList of feerates that are changed and why:\r\n- min relay feerate: significant conversion rate changes, see above\r\n- incremental relay feerate: should follow min relay feerate, see above\r\n- block minimum feerate: shouldn’t be above min relay feerate, otherwise the node accepts transactions it will never mine. I've knocked it down to the bare minimum of 1sat/kvB. Now that we no longer have coin age priority (removed in v0.15), I think we can leave it to the `CheckFeeRate` policy rule to enforce a minimum entry price, and the block assembly code should just fill up the block with whatever it finds in mempool.\r\n\r\nList of feerates that are not changed and why:\r\n- dust feerate: this feerate cannot be changed as flexibly as the minrelay feerate. A much longer record of low feerate transactions being mined is needed to motivate a decrease there.\r\n- maxfeerate (RPC, wallet): I think the conversion rate is relevant as well, but out of scope for this PR\r\n- minimum feerate returned by fee estimator: should be done later. In the past, we've excluded new policy defaults from fee estimation until we feel confident they represent miner policy (e.g. #9519). Also, the fee estimator itself doesn't have support for sub-1sat/vB yet.\r\n- all wallet feerates (mintxfee, fallbackfee, discardfee, consolidatefeerate, WALLET_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE, etc.): should be done later. Our standard procedure is to do wallet changes at least 1 release after policy changes.",

There's no reason to change the default.\r\n\r\n>Over that period the USD price of BTC has risen by roughly 2-3 orders of magnitude,\r\n\r\nIt's the USD that has fallen, Bitcoin has only increased *relative to* it. Actually, Bitcoin probably hasn't even kept up its value, so if anything we should be looking to increase the default relay fee, if maintaining the same actual-value cost is the goal.\r\n\r\n>The minimum relay feerate is a DoS protection rule, representing a price on the network bandwidth used to relay transactions that have no PoW.\r\n\r\nDoS resistance is clearly insufficient even at 1s/vB.\r\n\r\n> While relay nodes don't all collect fees, the assumption is that if nodes on the network use their resources to relay this transaction, it will reach a miner and the attacker's money will be spent once it is mined. \r\n\r\nThis assumption doesn't hold without common-sense spam filters, that Core has neglected and begun to remove.\r\n\r\n>Contrast this with the dust feerate, which defines a value as \"too small\" based on Bitcoin's protocol constraints on transaction volume (e.g. spend script size vs block space). The conversion rate is thus irrelevant or, at the very least, applies very differently in that context.\r\n\r\nNo, dust is defined as too small to be worth spending, which is a factor of fee rate to spend it. If the fee rate is 10x lower, the dust limit is logically 10x lower as well.",

      "body": "NACK. I think the direction of this change makes sense in isolation, but interacts too badly with other default mempool policy choices.\r\n\r\nUsers will always prefer to transact at the lowest fee given the current demand for tx confirmation, and miners will always prefer to earn more fees by filling blocks with extremely cheap txs rather than mine half empty blocks. Both these market forces are set to intensify over the long run as fiat inflation goes on and Bitcoin's block subsidy runs out. I don't even believe it's correct to think of tx fees as an anti-DoS protection: these forces virtually guarantee that in the long run miners will accept any tx paying at least 1 sat in total when they have nothing else to mine. Besides, if one was to argue that the minimum feerate acts as an anti-DoS mechanism like the OP does it would be contradictory to then propose cutting it down by a factor of 10x in the same breath.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the 1000 s/kvB floor arbitrarily discourages several kinds of large and beneficial txs when demand is low: super cheap coinjoins and super cheap dust consolidations (the latter is gaining importance because since Taproot activated the UTXO set [tripled in size](https://mainnet.observer/charts/utxoset-by-count/) and 50% of outputs hold dust).\r\n\r\nThe problem then, obviously, is Core's lack of mempool policies to keep datacarrying txs under control (a real DoS vector), which will even get worse once #32406 is released with Core v30. A cursory look at the mempool is enough to see that these parasitic txs are displacing coinjoins/consolidations and enjoying the low fee rates, even stalling the downwards trend on UTXO size that started in early 2025 (see above link).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBeyond the issue of this particular policy this episode laid bare once again the [critical state](https://mainnet.observer/charts/mining-pools-centralization-index/) of Bitcoin mining centralization. I find it baffling that a maintainer would conflate \"Bitcoin miner\" with \"pool operator\" by writing something as misleading as \"Miners (some say up to 85%) are choosing to mine these low feerate transactions\" when 99% of hashrate is still held captive by Stratum v1.\r\n\r\nToday 5 or 6 pool operators just decided to ignore a hare-brained policy that never made sense in the first place, but tomorrow this handful of publicly-known operators might enforce a blacklist under duress. The prospect that so few mining nodes materially define what gets mined or not is sobering and scary.\r\n\r\nThe silver lining is that as I write this miners of any size (even BitAxe miners) can mine with their own nodes and set their own mining policies while still pooling their hashrate, and there are already 192 mainnet blocks mined in such a fashion. I encourage the wider dev community to treat the mining centralization problem with the seriousness it deserves and help evangelizing the solutions that are already available and proven to work.",

      "body": "> > Contrast this with the dust feerate, which defines a value as \"too small\" based on Bitcoin's protocol constraints on transaction volume (e.g. spend script size vs block space). The conversion rate is thus irrelevant or, at the very least, applies very differently in that context.\r\n> \r\n> No, dust is defined as too small to be worth spending,\r\n\r\nLuke is correct here that was the original rationale for the dust setting, and remains the rationale documented in the comments in [policy.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8712e074bb54eea9ccc4d2009d2150279c9d17ec/src/policy/policy.cpp#L28-L41). I don't think that should be treated as the sole rationale, however; two other factors that should be considered are tht it's also an effective (in practice) limit on utxo size growth, and that dust limits need to be taken into account by second layer protocols that build on Bitcoin, so we don't have the same option to try decreasing them and then, if it turns out to be a bad idea, to re-increase them.\r\n\r\nEven if it \"worth the fees it will take to spend\" were the only rationale, that's still a good reason to have the dust rate set at a multiple of the minimum fee rate -- both to take into account that there should be some value retained after fees, and to take into account the fact that sometimes the required fee rate will be above the default minimum fee rate. At this point, I would say that until we've had a few years demonstrating that 0.3sat/vb is enough to get your tx mined consistently, we shouldn't even lower the dust limit to a level equivalent to 1sat/vb (vs the current 3sat/vb), let alone anything lower than that.\r\n\r\n> The cost to relay a transaction across the network is roughly its serialized size (plus relay overhead) x number of nodes. \r\n\r\nI think of that more as \"this cost to spam every node in the network with 1kB of data each if you did it by spinning up an ec2 node is [$x / GB] * [1e-6] * [number of nodes]\". The cost to do the same thing by relaying a valid 0.25kvB transaction and having nodes in the p2p network do the actual data transfer for you should be in the same range (preferably somewhat higher). With $120k/BTC and 90k p2p nodes, \"the same\" comes to 0.033sat/vb. The p2p nodes here aren't being paid for their costs -- miners collect the fees obviously, not p2p nodes -- you're just avoiding the p2p network providing attackers with a cheaper way of DoSing itself than commercial providers.\r\n\r\nWith mempool size limits enforced by a dynamic minimum fee, I don't think we need anything more than that to keep the network functional as far as tx relay goes.\r\n\r\n> Concept ACK but I believe that the justification for this being the price went up is weak. This suggests also we may just lower it again in the future if the price goes down.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, using ec2 hosts to spam the network would be cheaper than sending 0.1sat/vb tx, even given a 67% reduction in the BTC price (to $40k/BTC), or a 3x increase in the number of nodes on the network (to ~270k). If we had more than either of those, I think this setting should be revisited. (OTOH, if the price goes up by 3x and the number of nodes goes up by 3x, and commercial bandwidth prices stay roughly the same, that's a wash and there's no need to revisit it)\r\n\r\nI don't think giving a 90% fee discount to low value inscriptions is in miners' interests, and I don't think block relay efficiency concerns should be used to either remove policy options from node operators or (more importantly) miners or as the primary controlling factor in determining policy defaults. I think there are better ways to address those concerns, though, and I'm satisfied that bandwidth DoS should be the main factor influencing the default minimum fee for tx relay.\r\n\r\nApproach ACK.",

      "body": "Concept ACK, FWIW. The long and short of it is that mempool/relay (fee) policy is ineffective as a \"spam filter\", since the node will have to accept the transaction anyway if it is mined, so trying to use it as such is futile. Meanwhile, rejecting transactions that are being mined is detrimental to block propagation in particular and overall node/network performance in general. As such, changing the defaults to match what is actually being mined is warranted as long as the DoS resistance is not compromised, and I believe @ajtowns and others have provided convincing arguments that it is not.\r\n\r\n> Today 5 or 6 pool operators just decided to ignore a hare-brained policy that never made sense in the first place, but tomorrow this handful of publicly-known operators might enforce a blacklist under duress. The prospect that so few mining nodes materially define what gets mined or not is sobering and scary.\r\n\r\nYou're not wrong as such about miner centralization, but this is the opposite problem. The default mempool relay fee policy is preventing transactions that are being mined from being relayed by (most) nodes. Your hypothetical situation is where transactions are being relayed, but not mined by (some) miners. Presumably, if mining pools start censoring higher-paying transactions due to regulatory blacklisting, miners will migrate to pools in other jurisdictions that ignore them, if for no other reason than that they will be missing out on fees if they don't. Either way, I don't think this is really on-topic for this PR.",

      "body": "A substantial portion of Bitcoin transactors and miners are already using the value which this PR sets as default. Over the past month we've seen a non-trivial amount of sub-1sat/vb transactions. As an illustration of this, in the past day of block more than 23% of transactions (!!) used a feerate lower than 1sat/vb. That one quarter of the average block's content is not being relayed by default Bitcoin Core has a significant impact on block propagation, due to the additional time spent validating block transactions and additional roundtrips in block reconstruction. In fact if this trend continues i expect block propagation time will already be significantly impacted until the network adopts Bitcoin Core 30.0.\r\n\r\nYou can list all sub-1sat/vb transactions in the past day of blocks on your own Bitcoin Core node with the following `jq`-fu:\r\n```\r\nbc=\"bitcoin-cli -datadir=your_datadir\"; end=908109; start=$(($end - 144)); for h in $(seq $start $end); do hash=\"$($bc getblockhash $h)\"; $bc getblock $hash 2 |jq '.tx[] | select(.fee != null) | {feerate: (.fee / .vsize * 1e8 * 100 | round | ./100), txid} | select(.feerate < 1) | \"Transaction \\(.txid) has feerate \\(.feerate) sat/vb\"'; done\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo count the number of such transactions, just pipe it into `wc -l`. Running this on a local node i get:\r\n```\r\n$ bc=\"bitcoin-cli -datadir=your_datadir\"; end=908109; start=$(($end - 144)); for h in $(seq $start $end); do hash=\"$($bc getblockhash $h)\"; $bc getblock $hash 2 |jq '.tx[] | select(.fee != null) | {feerate: (.fee / .vsize * 1e8 * 100 | round | ./100), txid} | select(.feerate < 1) | \"Transaction \\(.txid) has feerate \\(.feerate) sat/vb\"'; done |wc -l\r\n93302\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can get the total number of transactions over this period by summing the `nTx` returned by `getblock` for all these blocks, or if you are lazy just drop the `select(.feerate < 1)` in the above command. Here i get:\r\n```\r\n$ bc=\"bitcoin-cli -datadir=your_datadir\"; end=908109; start=$(($end - 144)); for h in $(seq $start $end); do hash=\"$($bc getblockhash $h)\"; $bc getblock $hash 2 |jq '.tx[] | select(.fee != null) | {feerate: (.fee / .vsize * 1e8 * 100 | round | ./100), txid} | \"Transaction \\(.txid) has feerate \\(.feerate) sat/vb\"'; done |wc -l\r\n401684\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore `93302 / 401684 * 100 = 23.23` % of transactions in the past day of block used a feerate lower than 1sat/vb.\r\n\r\nLowering the default minimum feerate does not, as [detailed above](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106#issuecomment-3142444090), introduce a DoS vector and it allows Bitcoin Core's relay policy to match a sizeable share of Bitcoin's usage. Obvious Concept ACK.",

The calculations and rationales presented in this thread, mostly by @ajtowns (e.g. [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32959#issuecomment-3095260286), [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106#issuecomment-3142444090)) make sense to me, and a 10x decrease seems like it's in the right ballpark.\r\n\r\nEven though I don't think this policy should be used to artificially support miner revenue, I was initially concerned that miners might not be sufficiently incentivized to adopt this lower minimum feerate, thus creating a gap between a node's mempool and what would actually get mined. Looking at recently mined blocks across pools it seems that's not happening, so I don't see any reason anymore not to go ahead with this change.\r\n\r\nWill follow-up with a code review soon.",

      "body": "Yeah compact block reconstruction looks horrendous. Thanks @0xB10C!\r\n\r\nI looked a little bit at the distribution of sub-1sat/vB feerates to try make sure we're capturing the ones that are causing poor reconstruction. If a significant portion of transactions are even lower, I think we could lower this to 50sat/kvB while staying solidly within the DoS budget, but it doesn't seem necessary.\r\n\r\nThis is individual feerate from the last day's worth of blocks, showing 97% of them are >= 0.1sat/vB.\r\n\r\nIn the 3% of transactions that are below 0.1sat/vB, virtually all of them are 0-0.01sat/vB. My hunch is that these are often exactly 0 fee TRUC packages or miners' own transactions. I'm only seeing a small handful of transactions that are below 0.1sat/vB but not 0-0.01. In any case, I don't think we should go as low as 0.01sat/vB.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbc=\"bitcoin-cli -datadir=abc\"; end=908760; start=$(($end - 144)); for h in $(seq $start $end); do hash=\"$($bc getblockhash $h)\"; $bc getblock $hash 2 |jq '.tx[] | select(.fee != null) | {feerate: (.fee / .vsize * 1e8 * 1000 | round | ./1000), txid} | select(.feerate < 1) | \"Transaction \\(.txid) has feerate \\(.feerate) sat/vb\"'; done > lowfeetxs.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1061\" height=\"1035\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f41c43b7-4980-4f92-af5f-4a61ac78577f\" />\r\n\r\n```\r\nOverall Fee Rate Statistics (sat/vB):\r\n----------------------------------------\r\ncount          : 99122.0000\r\nmean           : 0.3538\r\nstd            : 0.1819\r\nmin            : 0.0000\r\n25%            : 0.1530\r\n50%            : 0.4030\r\n75%            : 0.4520\r\nmax            : 0.9990\r\n\r\nDetailed Fee Rate Distribution:\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n0.00 - 0.01 sat/vB:  2,979 txs (  3.0%)\r\n0.01 - 0.05 sat/vB:     16 txs (  0.0%)\r\n0.05 - 0.10 sat/vB:     23 txs (  0.0%)\r\n0.10 - 0.20 sat/vB: 26,387 txs ( 26.6%)\r\n0.20 - 0.30 sat/vB:  4,531 txs (  4.6%)\r\n0.30 - 0.40 sat/vB:  7,352 txs (  7.4%)\r\n0.40 - 0.50 sat/vB: 38,554 txs ( 38.9%)\r\n0.50 - 1.00 sat/vB: 19,280 txs ( 19.5%)\r\n\r\nWhether 0.1sat/vB is a good threshold:\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nZero fee transactions: 2,979\r\n0 < feerate < 0.1: 39\r\n0.1 ≤ feerate < 1.0: 96,104\r\n```",

By lowering the actual cost of transacting it expands the number of users that can afford to unilaterally transact and avoid these fake L2's altogether. It should be noted that these centralized fake L2's are also fantastic tools for surveillance and censorship. \r\n\r\nIf a concern with this PR is further enabling bad actors, it should be noted that it more importantly undermines the business models of other bad actors and is itself the final scaling frontier for sovereign ownership.

In the past, we've excluded new policy defaults from fee estimation until we feel confident they represent miner policy (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9519).

I've knocked it down to the bare minimum of 1sat/kvB. Now that we no longer have coin age priority (removed in v0.15), I think we can leave it to the `CheckFeeRate` policy rule to enforce a minimum entry price, and the block assembly code should just fill up the block with whatever it finds in mempool.\r\n\r\nI also feel like this (dropping block relay fee to the bare minimum) does not need to be bundled with the reduction of the minrelaytxfee and could be discussed separately. For what it's worth, the rationale given when the block minimum feerate was split-off from the minimum relay feerate was for it to represent miners' marginal cost of transmitting extra bytes.",

I wouldn't presume that all miners keep the defaults, but it'd be additionally bad if widely adopted: the network would be accepting and relaying transactions that never get mined, making the fees paid _actually zero_. Then we have a free relay problem.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to decipher exactly what people were thinking in 2016, but the context for #9380 is very different as, at the time, coin age priority allowed transactions to bypass minimum relay feerate. I think it made sense then to have an additional minimum feerate for mining since there were multiple DoS metrics for mempool admission. I'd guess that \"extra bytes\" also has something to do with the miner's risk/cost to relay their block, which also looks very different today. Perhaps there should be a miner setting that tries to filter out transactions that might hurt compact block propagation, but that's definitely a separate discussion.\r\n\r\nI think the premise of this PR is we've decided these 3 defaults don't make sense, so we should pick new values. I think `-blockmintxfee` should go down to at least 100sat/vB, but actually 1sat/kvB is most appropriate for aforementioned reasons. I don't feel extremely strongly, so I'm happy to make it 100sat/vB if it's a blocker.",

It creates an economic floor that helps maintain network health by ensuring transactions have some minimal economic weight. When we lower these defaults, we're essentially subsidising very low-value transactions at the expense of node operators' resources. \r\n\r\nThe ecosystem has evolved significantly since these values were originally set. We have Lightning Network for small payments, and various scaling solutions are maturing. Instead of lowering the bar for on-chain transactions, we should be encouraging proper use of these second-layer solutions. \r\n\r\nThere's also the risk of unintended consequences. Lower minimum fees could make certain types of spam attacks more economical, and we might not see the full impact until it's too late. The current values have been battle-tested through multiple market cycles. \r\n",

However, since coin age priority\nwas removed in v0.15, the block assembly policy is solely based on fees,\nso we do not need to apply minimum feerate rules in multiple places. In\nfact, the block assembly policy ignoring transactions that are added to\nthe mempool is likely undesirable as we waste resources accepting and\nstoring this transaction.\n\nInstead, rely on mempool policy to enforce a minimum entry feerate to\nthe mempool (minrelaytxfee). Set the minimum block feerate to the\nminimum non-zero amount (1sat/kvB) so it collects everything it finds in\nmempool into the block.",

Lower minimum fees could make certain types of spam attacks more economical, and we might not see the full impact until it's too late. The current values have been battle-tested through multiple market cycles.\r\n\r\nYes, it worked well for years.\r\n\r\nDefault Bitcoin Core limit of `maxmempool` is still 300MB and it is present no matter what fee the transaction is paying.\r\n\r\nOnce a public IP has an open port there is a lot of real network-level spam on it. I see that the same word \"spam\" can be used for application-level data, but please note the difference that the signature of a low-fee-rate Bitcoin transaction has to be valid and it has to be spending a known (previously validated) UTXO in order to get into node's mempool.\r\n\r\nYes, it may take more CPU time to verify the transaction compared to a simple packet drop done by a firewall but a valid transaction is filling a block that could have been empty. ~~(see UPDATE) If I was a miner I would happily accept any valid translation no matter what fee it pays because when I mine a heavy block there's no need to worry about any chain reorganization. Not the longest but the most-work chain matters. I wouldn't be surprised if the lower-fee-accepting miners (the majority of all right now) start to ignore (over-mine) half-empty blocks one day.~~\r\n\r\nMy point of view was the same as yours, when the full-RBF debate was heated. But soon I understood the miner's point of view and realized my node would accept any valid block no matter what i think.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: [most-work (PoW)](https://gist.github.com/harding/dabea3d83c695e6b937bf090eddf2bb3#abstract) chain of course. Thanks for [correction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106#issuecomment-3180559033) @ajtowns. I see I misunderstood it and really thought the weight of block matters.",

It seems to me that those defaults should rather be adjusted in tandem.\r\n\r\nIf the network is transitioning to accept transactions that previously wouldn't have been accepted, then it's important that a good number of public nodes will accept those transactions for relay, prior to them being included in blocks. Otherwise:\r\n\r\n * compact block relay becomes worse because the txs aren't widely available for reconstruction\r\n * user experience becomes worse, because txs don't get reliably relayed to the miners that accept them\r\n * privacy becomes worse, because users need to send their transactions to well known nodes rather than being able to be lost in the crowd of the p2p network\r\n\r\nDoing a phased enablement is one way to avoid those drawbacks: ie, distribute software that relays the txs first, before miners start mining them, and leave wallet support until later still. Doing a coordinated enablement is (IMO) another: ie, distribute software that turns on both relay and mining (and perhaps wallet enablement as well) on a set date that is some months after the software is widely released. The latter's what we do for soft forks, and it seems to work well, though that's obviously helped by there not being much value to anyone producing txs early in that case, even if they were to be relayed.\r\n\r\nI don't think phased enablement will be very effective in the current environment: memecoiners seem to be eager to use any new feature in order to differentiate their new schemes from past ones, and miners seem to be racing to include even marginally valuable txs in blocks, so I don't think attempts to separate mining and relay support are likely to work.",

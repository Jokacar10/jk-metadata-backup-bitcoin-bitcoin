    "body": "ML post for discussion about the general concept, how this impacts the wider ecosystem, philosophy about minimum feerates, etc: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/changing-the-minimum-relay-feerate/1886\r\n\r\nThis PR is inspired by #13922 and #32959 to lower the minimum relay feerate in response to bitcoin's exchange rate changes in the last ~10 years. It lowers the default `-minrelaytxfee` and `-incrementalrelayfee`, and knocks `-blockmintxfee` down to the minimum nonzero setting. Also adds some tests for the settings and pulls in #32750.\r\n\r\nThe minimum relay feerate is a DoS protection rule, representing a price on the network bandwidth used to relay transactions that have no PoW. While relay nodes don't all collect fees, the assumption is that if nodes on the network use their resources to relay this transaction, it will reach a miner and the attacker's money will be spent once it is mined. The incremental relay feerate is similar: it's used to price the relay of replacement transactions (the additional fees need to cover the new transactions at this feerate) and evicted transactions (following a trim, the new mempool minimum feerate is the package feerate of what was removed + incremental).\r\n\r\nAlso note that many nodes on the network have elected to relay/mine lower feerate transactions. Miners (some say up to 85%) are choosing to mine these low feerate transactions instead of leaving block space unfilled, but these blocks don't propagate as quickly to nodes that rejected or didn't hear about those transactions earlier.\r\n- https://x.com/caesrcd/status/1947022514267230302\r\n- https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000001305770e0aa279dcd8ba8be18c3d5cf736a26f77e06fd\r\n- https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000001b491649ec030aa8e003e1f4f9d3b24bb99ba16f91e97\r\n- https://x.com/mononautical/status/1949452586391855121\r\n\r\nWhile it wouldn't make sense to loosen DoS restrictions recklessly in response to these events, I think the current price is higher than necessary, and this motivates us changing the default soon. Since the minimum relay feerate defines an amount as too small based on what it costs the attacker, it makes sense to consider BTC's conversion rate to what resources you can buy in the \"real world.\"\r\n\r\nGoing off of [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32959#issuecomment-3095260286) and [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33106#issuecomment-3142444090)\r\n- Let's say an attacker wants to use/exhaust the network's bandwidth, and has the choice between renting resources from a commercial provider and getting the network to \"spam\" itself it by sending unconfirmed transactions. We'd like the latter to be more expensive than the former.\r\n- The bandwidth for relaying a transaction across the network is roughly its serialized size (plus relay overhead) x number of nodes. A 1000vB transaction is 1000-4000B serialized. With 100k nodes, that's 0.1-0.4GB\r\n- If the going rate for ec2 bandwidth is 10c/GB, that's like 1-4c per kvB of transaction data\r\n- Then a 1000vB transaction should pay at least 4c\r\n- $0.04 USD is 40 satoshis at 100k USD/BTC\r\n- Baking in some margin for changes in USD/BTC conversion rate, number of nodes (and thus bandwidth), and commercial service costs, I think 50-100 satoshis is on the conservative end but in the right ballpark\r\n\r\nList of feerates that are changed and why:\r\n- min relay feerate: significant conversion rate changes, see above\r\n- incremental relay feerate: should follow min relay feerate, see above\r\n- block minimum feerate: shouldnâ€™t be above min relay feerate, otherwise the node accepts transactions it will never mine. I've knocked it down to the bare minimum of 1sat/kvB. Now that we no longer have coin age priority (removed in v0.15), I think we can leave it to the `CheckFeeRate` policy rule to enforce a minimum entry price, and the block assembly code should just fill up the block with whatever it finds in mempool.\r\n\r\nList of feerates that are not changed and why:\r\n- dust feerate: this feerate cannot be changed as flexibly as the minrelay feerate. A much longer record of low feerate transactions being mined is needed to motivate a decrease there.\r\n- maxfeerate (RPC, wallet): I think the conversion rate is relevant as well, but out of scope for this PR\r\n- minimum feerate returned by fee estimator: should be done later. In the past, we've excluded new policy defaults from fee estimation until we feel confident they represent miner policy (e.g. #9519). Also, the fee estimator itself doesn't have support for sub-1sat/vB yet.\r\n- all wallet feerates (mintxfee, fallbackfee, discardfee, consolidatefeerate, WALLET_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE, etc.): should be done later. Our standard procedure is to do wallet changes at least 1 release after policy changes.",

      "body": "NACK. I think the direction of this change makes sense in isolation, but interacts too badly with other default mempool policy choices.\r\n\r\nUsers will always prefer to transact at the lowest fee given the current demand for tx confirmation, and miners will always prefer to earn more fees by filling blocks with extremely cheap txs rather than mine half empty blocks. Both these market forces are set to intensify over the long run as fiat inflation goes on and Bitcoin's block subsidy runs out. I don't even believe it's correct to think of tx fees as an anti-DoS protection: these forces virtually guarantee that in the long run miners will accept any tx paying at least 1 sat in total when they have nothing else to mine. Besides, if one was to argue that the minimum feerate acts as an anti-DoS mechanism like the OP does it would be contradictory to then propose cutting it down by a factor of 10x in the same breath.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the 1000 s/kvB floor arbitrarily discourages several kinds of large and beneficial txs when demand is low: super cheap coinjoins and super cheap dust consolidations (the latter is gaining importance because since Taproot activated the UTXO set [tripled in size](https://mainnet.observer/charts/utxoset-by-count/) and 50% of outputs hold dust).\r\n\r\nThe problem then, obviously, is Core's lack of mempool policies to keep datacarrying txs under control (a real DoS vector), which will even get worse once #32406 is released with Core v30. A cursory look at the mempool is enough to see that these parasitic txs are displacing coinjoins/consolidations and enjoying the low fee rates, even stalling the downwards trend on UTXO size that started in early 2025 (see above link).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBeyond the issue of this particular policy this episode laid bare once again the [critical state](https://mainnet.observer/charts/mining-pools-centralization-index/) of Bitcoin mining centralization. I find it baffling that a maintainer would conflate \"Bitcoin miner\" with \"pool operator\" by writing something as misleading as \"Miners (some say up to 85%) are choosing to mine these low feerate transactions\" when 99% of hashrate is still held captive by Stratum v1.\r\n\r\nToday 5 or 6 pool operators just decided to ignore a hare-brained policy that never made sense in the first place, but tomorrow this handful of publicly-known operators might enforce a blacklist under duress. The prospect that so few mining nodes materially define what gets mined or not is sobering and scary.\r\n\r\nThe silver lining is that as I write this miners of any size (even BitAxe miners) can mine with their own nodes and set their own mining policies while still pooling their hashrate, and there are already 192 mainnet blocks mined in such a fashion. I encourage the wider dev community to treat the mining centralization problem with the seriousness it deserves and help evangelizing the solutions that are already available and proven to work.",

The conversion rate is thus irrelevant or, at the very least, applies very differently in that context.\r\n> \r\n> No, dust is defined as too small to be worth spending,\r\n\r\nLuke is correct here that was the original rationale for the dust setting, and remains the rationale documented in the comments in [policy.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8712e074bb54eea9ccc4d2009d2150279c9d17ec/src/policy/policy.cpp#L28-L41). I don't think that should be treated as the sole rationale, however; two other factors that should be considered are tht it's also an effective (in practice) limit on utxo size growth, and that dust limits need to be taken into account by second layer protocols that build on Bitcoin, so we don't have the same option to try decreasing them and then, if it turns out to be a bad idea, to re-increase them.\r\n\r\nEven if it \"worth the fees it will take to spend\" were the only rationale, that's still a good reason to have the dust rate set at a multiple of the minimum fee rate -- both to take into account that there should be some value retained after fees, and to take into account the fact that sometimes the required fee rate will be above the default minimum fee rate. At this point, I would say that until we've had a few years demonstrating that 0.3sat/vb is enough to get your tx mined consistently, we shouldn't even lower the dust limit to a level equivalent to 1sat/vb (vs the current 3sat/vb), let alone anything lower than that.\r\n\r\n> The cost to relay a transaction across the network is roughly its serialized size (plus relay overhead) x number of nodes. \r\n\r\nI think of that more as \"this cost to spam every node in the network with 1kB of data each if you did it by spinning up an ec2 node is [$x / GB] * [1e-6] * [number of nodes]\". The cost to do the same thing by relaying a valid 0.25kvB transaction and having nodes in the p2p network do the actual data transfer for you should be in the same range (preferably somewhat higher). With $120k/BTC and 90k p2p nodes, \"the same\" comes to 0.033sat/vb. The p2p nodes here aren't being paid for their costs -- miners collect the fees obviously, not p2p nodes -- you're just avoiding the p2p network providing attackers with a cheaper way of DoSing itself than commercial providers.\r\n\r\nWith mempool size limits enforced by a dynamic minimum fee, I don't think we need anything more than that to keep the network functional as far as tx relay goes.\r\n\r\n> Concept ACK but I believe that the justification for this being the price went up is weak. This suggests also we may just lower it again in the future if the price goes down.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, using ec2 hosts to spam the network would be cheaper than sending 0.1sat/vb tx, even given a 67% reduction in the BTC price (to $40k/BTC), or a 3x increase in the number of nodes on the network (to ~270k). If we had more than either of those, I think this setting should be revisited. (OTOH, if the price goes up by 3x and the number of nodes goes up by 3x, and commercial bandwidth prices stay roughly the same, that's a wash and there's no need to revisit it)\r\n\r\nI don't think giving a 90% fee discount to low value inscriptions is in miners' interests, and I don't think block relay efficiency concerns should be used to either remove policy options from node operators or (more importantly) miners or as the primary controlling factor in determining policy defaults. I think there are better ways to address those concerns, though, and I'm satisfied that bandwidth DoS should be the main factor influencing the default minimum fee for tx relay.\r\n\r\nApproach ACK.",

      "body": "Concept ACK, FWIW. The long and short of it is that mempool/relay (fee) policy is ineffective as a \"spam filter\", since the node will have to accept the transaction anyway if it is mined, so trying to use it as such is futile. Meanwhile, rejecting transactions that are being mined is detrimental to block propagation in particular and overall node/network performance in general. As such, changing the defaults to match what is actually being mined is warranted as long as the DoS resistance is not compromised, and I believe @ajtowns and others have provided convincing arguments that it is not.\r\n\r\n> Today 5 or 6 pool operators just decided to ignore a hare-brained policy that never made sense in the first place, but tomorrow this handful of publicly-known operators might enforce a blacklist under duress. The prospect that so few mining nodes materially define what gets mined or not is sobering and scary.\r\n\r\nYou're not wrong as such about miner centralization, but this is the opposite problem. The default mempool relay fee policy is preventing transactions that are being mined from being relayed by (most) nodes. Your hypothetical situation is where transactions are being relayed, but not mined by (some) miners. Presumably, if mining pools start censoring higher-paying transactions due to regulatory blacklisting, miners will migrate to pools in other jurisdictions that ignore them, if for no other reason than that they will be missing out on fees if they don't. Either way, I don't think this is really on-topic for this PR.",

However, since coin age priority\nwas removed in v0.15, the block assembly policy is solely based on fees,\nso we do not need to apply minimum feerate rules in multiple places. In\nfact, the block assembly policy ignoring transactions that are added to\nthe mempool is likely undesirable as we waste resources accepting and\nstoring this transaction.\n\nInstead, rely on mempool policy to enforce a minimum entry feerate to\nthe mempool (minrelaytxfee). Set the minimum block feerate to the\nminimum non-zero amount (1sat/kvB) so it collects everything it finds in\nmempool into the block.",

      "body": "`CFeeRate` is a fraction. Prior to using `FeeFrac`, the denominator was always 1000. Now, it's whatever you want it to be (in this case, the tx size). It still has to round, as it needs to output an integer number of satoshis when evaluating the fee for a given size.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we weren't rounding before when the fee was always a multiple of the size. Now we have to round; we want the number of satoshis for a size at 0.1sat/vB. I made all the numbers play nice by making the denominator 4000. Another way to fix this is to remove the assertion at the end of the function, but I preferred to keep it since it clearly helped catch this problem.",

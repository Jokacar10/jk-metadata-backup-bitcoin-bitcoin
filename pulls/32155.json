    "body": "The Consensus Cleanup soft fork proposal includes enforcing that coinbase transactions set their\r\nnLockTime field to the block height minus 1, as well as their nSequence such as to not disable the\r\ntimelock. If such a fork were to be activated by Bitcoin users, miners need to be ready to produce\r\ncompliant blocks at the risk of losing substantial amounts mining would-be invalid blocks. As miners\r\nare unfamously slow to upgrade, it's good to make this change as early as possible.\r\n\r\nAlthough Bitcoin Core's GBT implementation does not provide the `coinbasetxn` field, and mining\r\npool software crafts the coinbase on its own, updating the Bitcoin Core mining code is a first step\r\ntoward convincing pools to update their (often closed source) code. A possible followup is also to\r\nintroduce new fields to GBT. In addition, this first step also makes it possible to test future\r\nConsensus Cleanup changes.\r\n\r\nThe commit making the change also updates a bunch of seemingly-unrelated tests. This is because those tests were asserting error messages based on the txid of transactions involved, and changing the coinbase transaction structure necessarily changes the txid of all tests' transactions.",

      "message": "miner: set the coinbase nLockTime to block height-1\n\nThe Consensus Cleanup soft fork proposal includes enforcing that coinbase transactions set their\nlocktime field to the block height, minus 1 (as well as their nSequence such as to not disable the\ntimelock). If such a fork were to be activated by Bitcoin users, miners need to be ready to produce\ncompliant blocks at the risk of losing substantial amounts mining would-be invalid blocks. As miners\nare unfamously slow to upgrade, it's good to make this change as early as possible.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin Core's GBT implementation does not provide the \"coinbasetxn\" field, and mining\npool software crafts the coinbase on its own, updating the Bitcoin Core mining code is a first step\ntoward convincing pools to update their (often closed source) code. A possible followup is also to\nintroduce new fields to GBT. In addition, this first step also makes it possible to test future\nConsensus Cleanup changes.\n\nThe changes to the seemingly-unrelated RBF tests is because these tests assert an error message\nwhich may vary depending on the txid of the transactions used in the test. This commit changes the\ncoinbase transaction structure and therefore impact the txid of transactions in all tests.\n\nThe change to the \"Bad snapshot\" error message in the assumeutxo functional test is because this\nspecific test case reads into the txid of the next transaction in the snapshot and asserts the error\nmessage based it gets on deserializing this txid as a coin for the previous transaction. As this\ncommit changes this txid it impacts the deserialization error raised.",

      "body": "Tested with Stratum v2 (https://github.com/Sjors/bitcoin/pull/68 + first commit here, SRI pool role connected to their custom signet, sv2 -> sv1 translator and a BitAxe). Indeed I'm seeing blocks at height N with `locktime` values of N-1 and `sequence` of 4294967294 (`0xFFFFFFFE`). I explained below why this just works(tm), unlike with Stratum v1.\r\n\r\nThere's a question about sequencing here, since it's a preparatory step towards the Great Consensus Cleanup proposal https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1800.\r\n\r\nIn a way it's similiar to #30681 and other PRs that prepared our mining code for the timewarp fix from that same BIP. But it's also different. Taking account of the timewarp fix only potentially impacts the timestamp of the first block in a retarget period, i.e. push it a bit in the future. This only happens under circumstances that are common on testnet4 but rare on mainnet. Whereas this PR impacts every mined block.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, for Stratum v1 this PR changes nothing, because `getblocktemplate` does not echo coinbase `nLockTime`. It will require expanding BIP22 / BIP23 and further changes downstream. But the Stratum v2 Template Provider (see #31098) does pass on this information, so any Stratum v2 pool out there will start doing this once it's in a release.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Stratum v1 support requires downstream changes is a good reason to get started early. Moreover, because deploying this soft fork is more involved than simply updating Bitcoin Core, it's potentially less safe. By changing the default mining behavior long before the fork activates (or even signals) the actual deployment would be a lot safer.\r\n\r\nHowever the BIP is brand new, so we shouldn't make these (specific) mining changes a fait accompli. Although nothing would break if we later abandon this approach in favor of another BIP30 fix, it still seems better to wait before doing this on mainnet until the BIP has been out there for a while.\r\n\r\nArguably, waiting for the v30 release is long enough and we can simply revert this PR if needed.\r\n\r\nAnother approach could be to make this testnet only, and then decide if we want to apply it to mainnet a bit closer to the release.\r\n\r\nI do think we should have this in v30 to at least enable downstream testing, along with any changes to `getblocktemplate`. And some people may prefer to test on mainnet. So yet another approach could be to put it behind a flag (default true for test networks).",

      "body": "> That's what activating the soft-fork does. But there's a chicken-egg problem, because one reason to delay activating a soft fork is because part of the ecosystem isn't ready\r\n\r\nSorry maybe I didn't explain myself. I meant to introduce the code, but without activating it and without activation date. So if this consensus change doesn't go forward, we make sure that we will not have hard fork because of nodes running a version with the check code implemented. Just put it there to say: \"Here it is this new condition, at some point this is going to have an activation date, start implementing it\". Maybe that's not the way to do it, just dropping ideas. \r\n\r\nAs @darosior said:\r\n> updating the Bitcoin Core mining code is a first step toward convincing pools to update their (often closed source) code\r\n\r\nSo I think that this is a more \"aggressive\" (or convincing 😉) way to convince them.",

    "body": "Add `contrib/justfile` containing useful development workflow commands.\r\n\r\nJust recipes can be run by symlinking `contrib/justfile` into the repository root:\r\n\r\n    ln -s contrib/justfile justfile\r\n\r\nAnd running:\r\n\r\n    just RECIPE\r\n\r\nFrom any subdirectory.\r\n\r\nAlso add `/justfile` to `.gitignore`, to ignore the symlink into the repository root.\r\n\r\n`just` is command runner with make-like syntax. It is not a build system, and only serves as convenient way of saving and running commands. It is available here:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/casey/just/\r\n\r\nAdded in `contrib/justfile`, since `just` is a large, unreviewed dependency. Developers considering using `just` should make sure to take this into consideration.\r\n\r\nI feel a bit uncomfortable opening a PR which adds a `justfile`, since I wrote and maintain `just`, but whenever I work on Bitcoin Core, I always wind up adding a `justfile` to make running and remembering commands easy, and I think others might find it useful as well.\r\n\r\nI thought that adding it to `contrib/justfile` would be best. I try to maintain `just` to high standards, but those standards are those of an open source developer tool project, not a highly security sensitive project like Bitcoin Core, so putting it in `contrib` signals that users should take that into consideration before using `just`.\r\n\r\n`just` supports a number of features that `make` doesn't, and in general is less error prone:\r\n\r\n- Recipes can take arguments\r\n- No `.PHONY` needed\r\n- Good error messages, both for runtime and syntax errors\r\n- Uses `{{â€¦}}` for interpolation instead of `$`, so no need to `$$`\r\n- List recipes with `just --list`\r\n- Completion scripts for most shells\r\n\r\nA `justfile` serves as a convenient way to save and run commands, and as a form of documentation of what commands developers are likely to need when working on the project.\r\n\r\nI included `configure`, `build`, `clean`, `test`, and `watch` commands, along with `d` and `cli` commands which run the built `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-cli` in regtest mode, forwarding any additional arguments.",

      "body": "I really enjoy making justfiles for projects I work on.\r\n\r\nAnd, whilst I would love to see some kind of community justfile added to this project, I can appreciate the hesitation to do so per the rationale given by @achow101 above.\r\n\r\nI've therefore taken a different approach myself, hosting a justfile at [https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/dotfiles](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/dotfiles/blob/master/justfile) which is designed to sit one directory higher than this repository's code, specifically so that it doesn't interfere with the source directory (and allows things like `git clean -dfx` to be run, which for me is now much more common post-cmake).\r\n\r\nIf this PR doesn't get any traction here, I'd welcome contributions/improvements to that file over there, and perhaps in the future we could link to it from this project or publicize it in some other way.\r\n\r\n> In the end, I think for this to be useful, the developer or user would have to write the justfile themselves. Trying to offer one (even if it is just an example) is almost guaranteed to only find use by a single person.\r\n\r\nJust looking at the differences between this PR and my justfile highlights this problem. Although that's not to say that I don't think there's a world we we _could_ supply a base justfile with some universal/\"essential\" commands. This type of thing has been common in makefiles (and contrib scripts) for a long time.",

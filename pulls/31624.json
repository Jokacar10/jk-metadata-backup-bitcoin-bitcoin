The same commit implements sigops checking in `ConnectBlock`.\r\n\r\nI still don't understand in what way this was supposed to help with backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nBut even if the original intention was for this code to be temporary, things have moved around so much that this would just have to rethought from scratch.\r\n\r\nI'll update the commit message to at least point to this historical commit.",

If it might be better to remove the check or update it?\r\n\r\nMight suggest expanding comment to something like \"This check underestimates the number of sigops because it does not count witness and p2sh sigops. This is not a problem for validation because ConnectBlock will check them. Having the check here is useful for mining even though it isn't perfect, and it could be improved in the future.\"",

I got the impression that you did think it was useful from \"It may be a good idea to actually improve the check here, since it's relied on by `getblocktemplate` in proposal mode and by #31981\" (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31624#discussion_r2053597806). But I guess you were saying it *could* be useful if it were improved, not that it is useful currently.\r\n\r\nAnyway I was mostly asking about this because I was confused. Assuming you are happy with PR in current form I will go ahead and merge this later today based on the two ACKs. Obviously there are more changes that could be made but this is a clear improvement over the status quo.",

I like when comments are there to help me navigate code and call out things that are notable, even repeat things that are \"clear,\" because I find most comments easier to read than most code, and I like when I can get an overview of what is happening by just reading the comments and not even looking at the code. I think other people don't use comments like that and see them more like a red flag or tax that has to be paid when code isn't expressive enough to communicate what is doing.\r\n\r\nSo I think the disagreement here may mostly come down to personal preference, but this feedback is helpful, and I will hold off merging this to see if there will be another ack or nack.\r\n\r\nAlso if have a clear alternative you like better feel free to post or link!",

      "body": "For me, comments are most useful in the following cases:\r\n\r\n1. When the code is confusing or difficult to understand in such cases, a high-level overview is helpful, especially when the code cannot be simplified.\r\n2. To provide justification for a function call or explain the rationale behind a particular decision.\r\n3. To offer warnings, notes, or contextual insights for the reader  I actually enjoy reading these kinds of comments, and I’ve noticed this is done in some places in the codebase.\r\n4. For documenting APIs.\r\n\r\nI checked [developer-notes.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md), and it seems there’s no dedicated section on comments. It would be nice to have one.\r\n\r\nWhat’s currently missing in this PR is a clear explanation of whether the check is redundant or necessary especially given that we already perform a full `sigops` count check in `ConnectBlock`. If that rationale were explicitly written, I believe it would be the most important part of the comment, similar to the size check above it.\r\n\r\nSo, I would categorize this PR as addressing point 3.\r\n\r\nEven without this PR, as @l0rinc mentioned, someone could dig into the code and eventually realize that it’s an incomplete check. But I think having a short comment above the function call making it explicit is okay.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don’t have a strong opinion on this. I just think the comment is correct and also gives an additional history of the check for who wants to work on 3 later hence my ACK.\r\n",

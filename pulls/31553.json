    "body": "Part of cluster mempool (#30289). Builds on top of #31444.\r\n\r\nDuring reorganisations, it is possible that dependencies get added which would result in clusters that violate policy limits (cluster count, cluster weight), when linking the new from-block transactions to the old from-mempool transactions. Unlike RBF scenarios, we cannot simply reject the changes when they are due to received blocks. To accommodate this, add a `TxGraph::Trim()`, which removes some subset of transactions (including descendants) in order to make all resulting clusters satisfy the limits.\r\n\r\nConceptually, the way this is done is by defining a rudimentary linearization for the entire would-be too-large cluster, iterating it from beginning to end, and reasoning about the counts and weights of the clusters that would be reached using transactions up to that point. If a transaction is encountered whose addition would violate the limit, it is removed, together with all its descendants.\r\n\r\nThis rudimentary linearization is like a merge sort of the chunks of the clusters being combined, but respecting topology. More specifically, it is continuously picking the highest-chunk-feerate remaining transaction among those which have no unmet dependencies left. For efficiency, this rudimentary linearization is computed lazily, by putting all viable transactions in a heap, sorted by chunk feerate, and adding new transactions to it as they become viable.\r\n\r\nThe `Trim()` function is rather unusual compared to the `TxGraph` functionality added in previous PRs, in that `Trim()` makes it own decisions about what the resulting graph contents will be, without good specification of how it makes that decision - it is just a best-effort attempt (which is improved in the last commit). All other `TxGraph` mutators are simply to inform the graph about changes the calling mempool code decided on; this one lets the decision be made by txgraph.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, the \"oversized\" property is expanded to also encompass a configurable cluster weight limit (in addition to cluster count limit). \r\n",

I don't think that's a problem.\r\n\r\nAfaik the move/swap idiom is only safe if the swapped-to value's dtor doesn't have any interesting ordering requirements or side-effects.\r\n\r\nAs a contrived example, a user may do something like:\r\n```c++\r\nstd::vector<TxGraph::Ref> vec;\r\n\r\nvec.push_back(txgraph->AddTransaction(fee));\r\nauto ref = txgraph->AddTransaction(fee2);\r\n...\r\nref = std::move(vec.back());\r\n```\r\nThe vector now holds the old ref and `UnlinkRef` will not be called until that element is removed. I realize it's allowed to be a \"valid but unspecified state\", but I wouldn't expect a ref to be hanging around.",

      "body": "Concept NACK. This is not an oversight, and a step backwards.\r\n\r\nThe reason for having this type of policy rule in earlier Script version environments is to discourage constructs that suffer from DoS concerns in the interpreter (known and unknown). For BIP342 we carefully analyzed any sources of non-linear scaling effects such as the amount of data hashed, and data structure growth:\r\n* some were addressed\r\n  * quadratic hashing through an O(1) hashing scheme, see [BIP341 fn15](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#cite_note-15)\r\n  * execution stack growth which was addressed in #16902\r\n* others have remaining consensus rules to curb their impact (the 1000 stack element limit remains in [BIP342](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki#resource-limits), as e.g. the cost of OP_ROT scales with the stack size).\r\n\r\nIt is of course possible there are oversights, and those might warrant measures to address them, but absent such concerns, I don't think this applies.\r\n\r\nMy belief that most proponents of this change however see this as a way to reduce unwanted on-chain data storage. While there is certainly a ton of data that I personally consider unwanted (and frankly, dumb), I don't believe this will address that:\r\n* Given the clear economic demand for this data (for better or worse), the best a policy rule can do is provide a mild inconvenience. The worst it can do is cause the development of mempool-bypassing transaction relay rails to miners, which I consider far more harmful in the long term that any current hype.\r\n* The specific change here might not even do that, as it's only a tiny marginal cost to satisfy the policy (split things across multiple inputs, or use other mechanisms).\r\n* The justification that once existed for data-filtering policies just doesn't apply anymore. Before organic transaction demand was sufficient to fill blocks, I think it was quite reasonable to discourage applications from freeloading on the unused space, as it actively increased resource costs for fully validating nodes of the nascent ecosystem. Today, unwanted data or not, blocks are full anyway, and the cost to validating nodes in the same.\r\n\r\nIn short, my view is that on-chain data storage is inherent to having a flexible scripting system, and ultimately Bitcoin already has a mitigation to bound its impact on validators: the block weight limit.\r\n",

Based on the technical arguments given by you and the reviewers, it is clear that the PR isn't a good idea or is at least very controversial. Changes to transaction relay policy that can impact people beyond the node operator should be discussed in the broader community beyond just Bitcoin Core. For example, I'd recommend starting a thread on the mailing list or Delving Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree and believe it was closed unfairly, I think it would be appropriate to bring this up to the larger group during the weekly irc meeting.

If any of those addresses aren't acceptable to our own mempool by default, that's a bug, and it shouldn't be hidden in this way. If we're deliberately making some addresses unspendable with a default config despite having previously supported them, that should be addressed by explicitly removing those classes of addresses from the test cases.",

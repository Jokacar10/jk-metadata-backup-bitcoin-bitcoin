    "body": "Opening as draft to facilitate discussions, this has some issues.\r\n\r\nThis special-case was introduced in #18044 to avoid hindering relay of witness transactions in adversarial situations where most connections on the network were still using txid-based relay. This is not a concern anymore. Since it is expensive to detect, get rid of the special case.\r\n\r\nThis may however cause issues for orphan resolution in adversarial situations, since fetching the parent is done using its txid. Greg Sanders pointed out to me on IRC this could be an issue for package relay. I'm opening here as draft to facilitate discussion.",

It would\nresult in those nodes including the txid of the transaction (== witness-stripped wtxid) to their\nrecent reject filter, which would significantly hinder the propagation of the honest non-stripped\ntransaction if most connections on the network are txid based relay.\n\nSupport for wtxid based relay was released with 0.21 in January 2021 and is now ubiquitous on the\nnetwork. Therefore this concern does not apply anymore and we can get rid of this special case.",

      "body": "It took me a while to remember the context here, since we had those discussions offline. I'll try to put a short summary here for anybody else who did not participate in those discussions or doesn't remember the details.\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour in master is the following. Upon Script validation failure of an unconfirmed transaction:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5e6dbfd14ea9eace1c7e5ee76b140be46a0ec855/src/validation.cpp#L1238-L1240\r\n\r\nIf the transaction has no witness attached, Script validation will be performed a second and third time to detect whether it is spending a witness program:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5e6dbfd14ea9eace1c7e5ee76b140be46a0ec855/src/validation.cpp#L1245-L1246\r\n\r\nThis 3-step logic was introduced along with Segwit in 8b49040854be2e26b66366aeae1cba4716f93d93, to avoid adding the txid of transactions with a mutated witness to the reject filter. This was changed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8525, after which witness transactions which failed validation were never added to the reject filter at all. This is because it would otherwise trivial for an attacker to hinder the propagation of a witness transaction until wtxid-relay (see #8279).\r\n\r\nThe witness malleation issue was fixed with wtxid-relay in #18044, since at this point inserting the wtxid of a rejected transaction in the reject filter won't prevent the same transaction with a different (valid) witness to be accepted in the future (if it is announced on wtxid relay connection). However, this 3-step script validation logic was still necessary until the network was mostly upgraded to wtxid relay. This is because otherwise one malicious peer could still interfere with the honest transaction relay of all txid-relay peers. The attack is as follows:\r\n- An honest node has N txid-relay peers and one malicious wtxid-relay peer (the malicious peer can be wtxid or txid it doesn't matter).\r\n- A valid witness transaction is broadcast. Before any of its honest txid-relay peers sends the valid witness transaction to the node, the malicious peer sends it after stripping its witness.\r\n- The honest node now has the wtxid of the witness-stripped transaction, i.e. the txid of the transaction, in its reject filter. Any honest txid-relay peer trying to announce the valid witness transaction will hit the reject filter.\r\n\r\nThis is not a concern anymore because wtxid-relay was released on 2021-01-15 with 0.21.0. Nowadays, virtually all connections on the network are wtxid-relay. Therefore we can get rid of performing 3 times the expensive Script validation on non-witness transactions relayed to us for ~free. This is the argument made by [OP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32379#issue-3028559212).\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the full story. Since wtxid-relay was introduced a new ~~form of~~ dependency on \"txid-based transaction resolution\" was introduced with 1p1c package relay (h/t @instagibbs and @glozow). It is still possible for a malicious peer to interfere with parent resolution in this case. That is, if this resolution checks the reject filter, which @glozow shared a branch to stop doing: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32379#pullrequestreview-2816057986.\r\n\r\nTherefore this change is in the end a tradeoff between getting rid of the 3x script validation and being able to cache rejected parents in 1p1c.",

Although maybe that won't lead to too many redownloads in practice, since the filter will still exist at `inv` receipt. Or maybe we also skip when the `getdata` is of type txid? Will have a think.",

Nowadays, virtually all connections on the network are wtxid-relay. \r\n\r\nDigging out some things from my (faint) memory, there was also some discussion about whether it's problematic if some service uses txid-based relay and an attacker tries to censor their transactions by sending everybody witness stripped versions ahead of time. I think we concluded that this level of attack (where attacker is the first person to hear about it AND manages to frontrun every single connection made by the victim) is out of scope.",

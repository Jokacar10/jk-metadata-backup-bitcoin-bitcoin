They do not have an address type so the vast majority of users are completely unable to send to them. Sending to such requires specialized software and quite a bit of communication in order to get the script right. It requires some technical knowhow on the sender side to do correctly.\r\n\r\nArguably the same should be done for P2PK outputs as well for the same reasons.\r\n\r\nNote that this change (and any future proposal to do the same for P2PK) only affects new outputs. Spending existing outputs is still standard and allowed so as to avoid any potential confiscation of funds. Only transactions that create new bare multisig outputs would be considered non-standard.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n> disallowing non-multisig p2sh would reduce spam, pure conjecture.\r\n\r\nThis PR has nothing to do with non-multisig P2SH.

Bloating the blocks with huge data streams is bad enough for full nodes, but bloating the UTXO set is worse and in the last 4 moths it has grown at an unprecedented 40%[^1] due to a tidal wave of BRC-20 transactions that pay more fees than sats they move just to inscribe small json payloads that are well below 10k bytes[^2].\r\n\r\nFortunately detecting these transactions does not involve decoding the script and looking for ASCII strings or some other patterns of data. It's as simple as detecting the `OP_0` `OP_IF` data envelope in the script, and an unofficial patch that does that has been circulating informally since early February[^3]. I see no reason why a more refined version of this patch (with proper unit tests etc) should not make its way into Bitcoin Core eventually, as it's the same kind of issue (and mitigation) we're dealing in here.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://statoshi.info/d/000000009/unspent-transaction-output-set?orgId=1&refresh=5s&from=now-1y&to=now&viewPanel=8\r\n![utxo_set](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/1456708/2062707d-e256-46de-951c-d695966be4ef)\r\n\r\n[^2]: See for instance [this transaction](https://mempool.space/tx/6e463cf71ebc8a374fa4f43fb6c60ab16551ef666b4f72d67efaa8e88db8d1ca) and its [block](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004261d7e1e194c3dd45c6f5d3e5c2d46268f0215a26280), which is filled with other BRC-20 inscriptions.

      "body": "I ran the numbers on bare multisig usage between blocks 700,000 and 800,000 (approx. last two years). Because most of bare multisig activity is never spent outputs, I focused on bare multisig inputs and how old the spent coins are.\r\n\r\nThere were 940 bare multisig inputs during the analyzed period. 28% of them were spending coins created in the same block, while the median coin age was 224 blocks, and 90% of the coins were 14,599 blocks or fewer old. So while the actual usage of bare multisig for transactions is low, it's not just people sweeping old wallets, and they would be negatively impacted by not being able to create new outputs.\r\n\r\nSo for now, assuming this change is adopted and the peer-to-peer network stops reliably relaying transactions creating bare multisig outputs, these appear to be the consequences:\r\n\r\n- People determined to store data in the UTXO set (which is a terrible idea, but they still do it) will move to a different output type (such as P2TR, or perhaps an unused 40-byte SegWit output type) with slightly lower encoding efficiency, with potentially worse consequences for the UTXO set size.\r\n- However, since the actual usage of bare multisig even for outputs is low, the actual consequences for the UTXO set are likely to be negligible either way.\r\n- A small minority of users who appear to actually be using bare multisig for transactions will be forced to move to a different output type.\r\n\r\nAs there don't appear to be any benefits of this change, it's a NACK from me.\r\n\r\nSide note, a proposal to change the default policy really should be accompanied (I'd even say preceded) by a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.",

There are at least 200,000 BIP47 payment codes (that users have opted in to uploading to a public web directory) in the wild across three independent wallets - with more coming I am told. \r\n\r\nRegarding version 3 payment codes, we have fully implemented Version 3 of BIP47 into our wallet library ExtLibJ for over a year. See test vectors here https://code.samourai.io/wallet/ExtLibJ/-/blob/develop/src/test/java/com/samourai/wallet/bip47/rpc/obpp05/TestVectorsOBPP_RFC05.java\r\n\r\nI don't think it is wise to assume that no one is using BIP47 Version 3, nor should it be expected that developers come pay homage and plead their case to the maintainers and contributors of this repository as was suggested earlier in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you @Davidson-Souza and @1ma for thinking of BIP47 in the context of this PR\r\n\r\nConcept NACK",

P2MS is just P2PK with the ability to bake up to 2 more pubkeys to the chain even if those pubkeys don't actually have known private keys.\r\n\r\n2. **Long term storage** because of the nature of P2SH and P2WSH scripts for multisig.

      "body": "### Alternative\r\n\r\n~~What about reducing the standardness to only accept uncompressed format public keys thus reducing the capacity to spam due to cost. This would roughly double the amount of data that someone would have to include in their tx making the data overhead prohibitively expensive to spam. The efficiency of data storage would also decrease since only 50% of the pubkey data would be usable (_the y component would not have valid data._ ) Since a compressed point is equal to a uncompressed point P2MS would be functionally equivalent for any developer or users that want to use P2MS as their custody solution. I also doubt anyone creating a standard P2MS or P2PK TX for monetary exchange would have any issue paying the overhead for their tx which would be a maximum of 96 bytes.~~\r\n\r\nEdit: This would not work since only size is checked as a part of is standard not validity of (x and Y) components of the pubkey.\r\n\r\n### Aside\r\nJust scraped my UTXO set using https://github.com/in3rsha/bitcoin-utxo-dump and filtered my set for only p2ms keeping all row data and the total size is 278MB which is incredibly small even compared to P2PKH which sits at 1.9GB\r\n\r\nHere are some sizes to show how little data has actually bloated the UTXO set using P2MS and P2PK, even P2PKH uses far more space at ~10x.  _*script is the size of the serialized data only_\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/3104223/7b025ffa-80b7-411d-9a38-99a6710dc6e5)\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Thank you for your input @samouraiwallet.\r\n\r\nI admit that when I gave my ACK I thought this change was a no-brainer (for the reasons @mikeinspace exposed above) and now I'm conflicted. I wasn't aware of BIP47 v3, and in my personal opinion it is a valid use case. I've reviewed the extent of the work you and others have done on it in the last years and I've realized how extremely pissed you and the more privacy-focused Bitcoin community must be about this proposed change.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to say that as a full node runner I'm about equally pissed that you designed and implemented a legit use case for storing data onchain that I need to keep in the UTXO set, especially since BIP47 and Whirlpool's Tx0 have always used OP_RETURN. If BIP47 v3 took off and there were tens of millions of BIP47 v3 notification transactions (which would arguably be a good thing for privacy) it would also contribute to worsen the UTXO set bloat problem for no good reason.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid our main goals and time horizons are fundamentally at odds on this issue, so I maintain my ACK. You should have more leeway in 2023 to redesign BIP47 v3 on top of OP_RETURN than I'll have in 2050 to run a full node if bare multisig data storage for legit use cases were to take off from here on.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nTo those who argue against the change on the grounds that bare multisig data storage is not so bad **today**, I'd say that it shows that not a lot of people have cared about it so far, and that it's better to unstandardize it while that's the case. On these grounds I also support @Semisol's suggestion to unstandardize P2PK outputs.\r\n\r\nI wasn't aware of the technical advantages of P2MS over P2SH/P2WSH pointed out by @russeree and they also seem a valid objection to me, but still @vostrnad showed that bona fide P2MS seems to happen very rarely in practice, so given the downsides I don't think they're compelling enough for me.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIn general, regarding data embedding onchain I think that 80-byte OP_RETURNs are the Schelling point that all camps find tolerable (here I'm excluding self-professed Bitcoin adversaries such as Mike).\r\n\r\nEven a good chunk of the people who are opposed to adding new standardness rules claim to only do so because they fear unintended consequences, and because this feels like a never-ending \"cat and mouse\" game. However this is just one way to frame this situation.\r\n\r\nAnother way to frame the situation is that Mike, Casey et al are unsuspecting QA engineers working for Bitcoin Core for free, doing what essentially amounts to fuzz testing of the script interpreter. I don't see why Core cannot freeride on the countless hours they spend looking for contrived ways to embed data onchain to timely maintain an evolving set of standardness rules that nudge users towards OP_RETURN. There surely are talented people that'd like to work on that. The next step in proactiveness would be setting up bounties for finding novel data envelopes that evade the latest spam filters and disclose them responsibly, so that they can be unstandardized before they explode like `OP_0` `OP_IF` did. Maybe it'd be enough motivation for some of these spammers to turn white-hat and do their thing in testnet and signet instead of mainnet.\r\n\r\nFinally, there's the issue of potential full-on tidal wave of off-band spam with this approach. Personally I'm skeptical of the spammers' ability to actually weaponize the miners against the system. For one, even if they are profit-driven they are also some of the most invested entities in Bitcoin's success. For the other, if off-band spam really got to a point where it threatens the system I guess they'd jack up the off-band fees to a point where it evens out. However I can't back this up, it's just what seems more likely to me.",

Citing from the [OBPP5](https://github.com/OpenBitcoinPrivacyProject/rfc/blob/master/obpp-05.mediawiki):\r\n> Alice's wallet should spend the notification change output at the next appropriate opportunity.\r\n\r\nJustus Ranvier designed it that way so that these notifications are more block space efficient and do not create any waste UTXOs on notification addresses like v1 does. He also thought about when these notification outputs should be created so that there really is no waste:\r\n> Wallets SHOULD prefer to create of notification outputs in any situation where a change output is required, if the wallet knows of the existence of any payment codes but has not yet sent a notification.",

      "body": "The status of BIP0011 likely should be changed to ```obsolete``` or modified to reflect changes to enablement if or upon merge as well since it would no longer be applicable to Bitcoin as intended. Does a new BIP need to be constructed to obsolete [BIP0011?](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0011.mediawiki) My position remains as NACK; none the less just brining about some of my thoughts and how they pertain if there was a merge.\r\n\r\nEdit: Digging deeper\r\n\r\n1. Technically there is not a need to replace a BIP to obsolete it. Per BIP002 ```When a Final BIP is no longer relevant, its status may be changed to Replaced or Obsolete (which is equivalent to Replaced). This change must also be objectively verifiable and/or discussed.```\r\n\r\n2. There is no precedent for obsoleting an 'active' BIP before. only BIP0064 has moved from draft->obsolete. \r\n\r\n3. The replaced option for the status of BIP0011 doesn't make sense unless there is a replacement for BIP11 outlining the reasons removing BIP0011 form isStandard improves BitCoin. **This doesn't make much sense because it would be a negation BIP**\r\n\r\n4. The context of BIP11 explicitly adding bare-multisig to isStandard() would force a change of status of the BIP if this got merged.\r\n\r\n_A personal thought: A BIP obsoleting change should have a larger and more diverse set of community discussion. Possibly even running it through the mailing list first. As it stands the ACKs/NACKs ratio doesn't even reach 2/3, currently at 64.5% ACK rate_\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit 2: Some additional thoughts and info** \r\n\r\n\r\nI ran some scripts against the stamps encoded P2MS transactions. Scraping the data of  74188 that were present at height 803187.\r\n\r\n![Figure_1e](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/3104223/7cfc0c80-78e7-4939-bf44-8f8573195a44)\r\n\r\n![Figure_1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/3104223/b332bc28-4662-406e-8406-d0acacaa23da)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit 3: For DraghtBot my stance is still NACK**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "### Primary Response \r\n@Retropex The statement provided is fairly rife with fallacies. Noting a couple of them here with a solution at the bottom.\r\n\r\n> Although there was a debate in particular with the BIP47, we must not forget that some people like Mike are there only to protect their business with the src-20 and stamps. They absolutely do not care about the decentralization of Bitcoin and the consequences it has on the nodes.\r\n\r\nAd Hominem (Attacking a Person): Just because Mike has a business interest doesn't automatically invalidate his statement. In addition do we actually know if mike has a 'business' that is of focus in the first place?\r\n\r\nHasty Generalization: The above statement seems to assume that people like Mike \"absolutely do not care about the decentralization of Bitcoin and the consequences it has on the nodes\" without presenting sufficient evidence to justify such a broad generalization.\r\n\r\n> In addition, on your graph we see that the demand for stamps is much calmer, but absolutely nothing prevents a new wave of stamps. I think we must not wait for a new wave to act.\r\n\r\nAppeal to Fear:  The above statement's caution against waiting for a new wave to act is an attempt to persuade through fear rather than through logical conclusion.\r\n\r\n**Overall**\r\n\r\nThis discussion should stay as objective as possible using data, analytics, and critical thinking, precedent, historical evidence, and or other useful insights whilst removing emotions and personal attacks.\r\n\r\n### **Some additional corrections to the initial PRs content to avoid a double post.**\r\n\r\n> By refusing non-P2SH multisignature transactions from the outset, [...] \r\n\r\nThis is not true at all, firstly there are other types of multi-signature transactions such as P2WSH _(segwit)_ and P2TR _(taproot)_. The other element that is false would be stating \"By refusing [...] transactions from the outset\". This is not true at all since this would be a relay policy and only directs a node to how to handle a bare multisig transaction in terms of relaying and placing into it's own mempool. Bare-multisig TXs at the block validation level would not be refused and **refusing base-multisig from the UTXO set would require a softfork** \r\n",

      "body": "> * \"What if we do it in the worst way possible? What if we store it in the UTXO set?\"\r\n\r\nHe is wrong about this, the worst way possible would be to use P2PK instead of P2MS since it would increase the number of outpoints per arbitrary data TX by 3x. \r\n\r\n> @russeree, your response is a red herring because you're distracting from the fact that Mike openly states that he's _\"polluting the UTXO set\"_ with _\"toxic waste\"_:\r\n\r\nThis is actually a proper response, thanks citing sources and facts. My counter point is that it through evidence cited above regarding the type of 'bloat' (_toxic waste_) in the UTXO set. Using this line of thinking inscriptions should also be removed from isStandard becuase of the statements made at [Bitcoin 2023 \"The Great Ordinal Debate\"](https://youtu.be/AdYsQ2DWt5M?t=191) \"There is no value here ... it's like an objective crap\" while referring to inscriptions. \r\n\r\n> * \"I'm ruining bitcoin\"\r\n\r\nThis behavior was also demonstrated in the exact same piece reference above [The Great Ordinal Debate - Bitcoin 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdYsQ2DWt5M&t=80s) The act of proclaiming to break or tarnish Bitcoin is more a form of hubris rather than rooted in reality. \r\n\r\nThe effect of stamps bloat are minimal compared to inscriptions and ordinals in terms of the total number of items and amount data added to the UTXO set. This to me is likely because of the cost to use stamps instead of the discounted methods such as inscriptions.  Stamps has largely been unused on a per block basis for nearly 10k blocks yet the UTXO set still has a historically high rate of growth. Meaning the sources of bloat are coming from other types of transactions. Do you have data to show otherwise? \r\n\r\n**A personal opinion**. This is one person in all of Bitcoin. His statements may be bold and in some ways true but nonetheless there is context. Example when he discusses the 'toxic waste' he seems to be saying it more to agitate the inscriptions crowd and almost personifying the community of people who don't like inscriptions. As such if someone didn't like inscriptions, yes stamps would be much worse when looked at through the lens of data storage. He also mentions pre segwit nodes in his statement, that is less than .3% of the network right now. Making something look much bigger and important than it is.\r\n\r\n### Technical Reasoning this is not the best means to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThis PR as a measure to reduce the use of P2MS without the disabling of P2PK in the short term may cause even more bloat to the UTXO set in the short term as P2PK would likely be used as an alternative to P2MS and thus using 1 outpoint per pubkey instead of 1 outpoint per 3. \r\n\r\nSince this is a relay rule and not an actual consensus rule. To get around this in a way would be to recompile Bitcoin Core ```net.h``` with ```static const unsigned int DEFAULT_MAX_PEER_CONNECTIONS = 9999;``` or some incredibly high number in order to broadcast your TX and give it a higher chance of hitting a miner. This would mean your node would occupy more slots centralizing node running to a degree.\r\n\r\n",

P2MS was originally selected because it offered a cost-effective method to achieve this. If P2MS becomes inefficient or difficult to relay, the next logical choice would be P2PK. This would lead to an even faster inflation of the UTXO set.\r\n\r\n> all these exploitable quirks\r\n\r\nWhile definitions of what are 'quirks' are made with good intentions, they are not necessarily objective. Also setting precedent here for a cat and mouse game around which 'quirks' would likely be a fools errand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Using a p2wsh tx outpoint would allow users to embed up to 256 bits (_32 bytes_) of arbitrary data per. These outpoints would also be unprunable. \r\n\r\nThe usable data storage capabilities of p2wsh are equal to p2pk with 32 bytes per outpoint. This would increase the number of required outpoints by 3x compared to p2ms. \r\n\r\nThe existence of p2wsh in this context makes restricting p2pk relaying a moot point. Which has been discussed. The same would apply for taproot outpoints. \r\n\r\n@Retropex \r\n> Precisely I made the request via [Bitcoin-dev](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-July/021805.html) and via an PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27589 (I know the PR are not intended for that)\r\n\r\nSorry, for my lack of clarity. My intention was to show that by using this evidence against one type of use case in Bitcoin. That same logic could/would be applied to other use cases in Bitcoin. One could attack Bitcoin by being boastful and arrogant about the way that they use Bitcoin, cause community outrage as a from of gathering consensus to change Bitcoin in a way that overall makes everyone worse off on longer time horizons.\r\n\r\n>\r\n> Unfortunately despite the fact that this is not an isolated request (almost) no developer has helped us on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe beauty is that you are the dev!

The term \"unfortunately\" connotes a negative view on the situation, implying that the outcome or response (or lack thereof) from developers is unfavorable or less than desirable. \r\n\r\n> Unlike @petertodd who tried to remove a tool for nodes runner #28130, I want others to be implemented. \r\n\r\nHis solution when compared to yours side by side are very similar since his is also a modification of the default behavior with an additional command line override including a zero length for those who do not want to relay OP_RETURN. \r\n\r\n> I just want to have tools to give nodes runner the choice.\r\n\r\nThe tools are already in Bitcoin Core, these changes are modifying preferences for the default behavior. Much like a video game has a settings screen with siders and values that change the experience.\r\n\r\nNothing new has been developed for created, merely debating the best position for the default sliders to be in.

Much like a video game has a settings screen with siders and values that change the experience.\r\n> \r\n> Nothing new has been developed for created, merely debating the best position for the default sliders to be in.\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree with your last sentence, this is one more small attempt and step as I see it, of a node operator, to proactively DO SOMETHING that even if seamingly small, have an effect of tightening the circle around making hash-anchoring to Bitcoin a bit more CUMBERSOME, assuming NEW node operators will likely not be aware of what each default settings does at start. We all know that NEW node operators unfortunately are NOT popping up from everywhere every day, and only about 17.000 full nodes are currently supporting Bitcoin's network, estimated 0.0002% of users. So for me this is by far definitely a great initiative and we need actually also the coding of more options for full node SW, so operators can to be the ones to DECIDE what really is CORE (=PRIMARY SCOPE) to Bitcoin, as Bitcoin's decentralization is SUSTAINED by tyranically (Satoshi's term) keeping that CORE=CENTRAL the tiniest possible. Not Devs (=service providers, in conflict of interests).",

      "body": "> You're assuming that they would use p2pk with _compressed_ keys. _Uncompressed_ keys are cheaper though because they can store 64 bytes.\r\n\r\n~~uncompressed pubkeys dont work that way since Bitcoin Core checks to make sure the Y is valid for X. As such trying to attach arb. data to X and Y will cause that check to fail and the script won't be considered standard. This is why stamps uses uncompressed public keys.~~\r\n\r\nValidated that though stamps doesn't use uncompressed public keys. P2MS uncompressed pubkeys are valid even if the X and Y point do not lie on the SECP256K1 curve. These outputs could be pruned safely from the UTXO set since they can not be signed for.\r\n\r\nhttps://mempool.space/testnet/tx/46013539ea25c8a083c98d57dcbf6365611ed902acd91b8656a022e84ff8f0e7#flow=&vout=0\r\n\r\n~~See my reply here.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28217#issuecomment-1667418511~~\r\n\r\nEdit 1: After further digging neither p2pk or multisig checks for valid (x,y) components just a valid size. 😲 IMO this would be a much better place to start since there is no way any rational user would use an uncompressed public key with an invalid 'Y' component. Is there checking at a deeper level before the TX gets to the mempool that I am missing?\r\n\r\n**P2PK**\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/60d3e4b0cd8716a6fe1be6b4d1b8237da8e56126/src/script/standard.cpp#L63-L75\r\n\r\n**P2MS**\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/60d3e4b0cd8716a6fe1be6b4d1b8237da8e56126/src/script/standard.cpp#L112-L132\r\n\r\nThis function should do the job perfectly.\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/60d3e4b0cd8716a6fe1be6b4d1b8237da8e56126/src/pubkey.cpp#L297-L302\r\n\r\n> The number of outpoints is irrelevant. Relevant is the per-byte cost of bloating the UTXO set.\r\n\r\nNot completely true, the more outpoints in the utxo set the longer the lookup time and the bigger the index gets also more disk write activity. \r\n",

Bitcoin's decentralization dependents solely on its user and voluntary supporters=node operators. They decentralize decision, and therefore not dictate. What you or Devs in obvious conflict of interests want is to exploit their full nodes and use Bitcoin for something it was clearly not made for since it's decentralization dependents exactly of keeping its SCOPE PRIMARY AND TINY, and NOT become another CENTRALIZE DB. Node operators with their decentralized decision making, as the ONLY WITHOUT conflict of interests ARE the ones to be given option in their node operators to decide. This specific request is actually a very weak one, and just a tiny attempt  to keep closing the circle to hash-anchoring (=stamping) to Bitcoin, something it CANNOT DO SIMULTANEOUSLY with STAYING DECENTRALIZED.",

My reasoning for ACK: regarding full nodes, always by default ALLOW OPTIONS, AND NEVER IMPOSE POSITIVE DEFAULTS. THAT IS DICTATORSHIP DISGUISED. This is the difference between positivist doctrine law, where fiat thrives on, vs. the Non-Aggession Principle(NAP) correctly aligned with the Bitcoin principles, IMV.",

      "body": "Concept NACK.\n\nBitcoin moves value* through time + space.\n\n*Value is subjective. (Value, in Bitcoin, is subjectively determined by the fee-rate of the tx.)\n\nBitcoin is a cypherpunk system. Bitcoin is based on crypto-anarchy. This is a colorful way of saying that Bitcoin is about freedom, including free markets.\n\nBitcoin's anti-DoS mechanism is not about Bitcoin Core sending political messages to dictate to the economy what it should or should not do.\n\nBitcoin's anti-DoS mechanism is based on fee-rate of txs.\n\nTherefore, there should be no prejudice on the mempool layer, as far as which kind of value is \"good\" or \"bad\", due to Bitcoin's primary ethos being dedicated to freedom, permissionlessness, and censorship-resistance.\n\nIn the case of arbitrary data txs, this is even more critical due to financial incentive. In 2023, the free market already voted in favor of arbitrary data txs, with a total of 8,500 BTC paid in fees by arbitrary data buyers of block space to sellers of block space, which was more than 1/3 of total fees.\n\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/11140618/feb639a8-4379-4f5d-ba82-841026127514)\n\nThus, any attempt to interfere carries obvious and severe risks and unintended consequences, for both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin:\n\n1. It sends a message that Bitcoin Core is being political, by trying to interfere in free market activity on the network by censoring valid fee-paying txs. It also would not dissuade activity, rather it would invigorate the arbitrary data economy due to being able to credibly claim censorship attempt. Permissionlessness quality means Bitcoin users do not require permission, not from Bitcoin Core nor from any other. Bitcoin operates on financial incentives of free markets. We have already seen in 2023 that the arbitrary data economy was only motivated by attempts to restrict their activity. It created a counter-culture that seemed \"cool\", in a rebellious \"stick it to the man\" sense.\n\n2. The update to Bitcoin Core is very likely ineffective, just virtue signaling (which Bitcoin Core should not be in the business of doing, as it makes a mockery of Bitcoin Core to implement changes that lack efficacy), since to change the public mempool relay situation, you would need iirc 85-92% of nodes to update. This is very low probability, as a significant minority or more of nodes simply refuse to update, and others wait years before updating. Also, users of arbitrary data obviously have an incentive to respond by running nodes without the change.\n\n3. Even if (2) is resolved in a low probability scenario, the arbitrary data economy can simply and quickly stop using the public mempool relay, and switch to miners' private mempool relay, by sending txs directly to miners. (Remember, there is a very strong financial incentive to route around any attempted censorship by Bitcoin Core.) This splits the mempool into 2 pieces: public and decentralized vs. private and centralized. Even if miners made their own mempool public at some point, it would need to be trusted, cannot verify, which incentivizes miners to lie about the real state of the mempool to increase fees paid. Nothing about this is good. It can cause pressure to centralize mining.\n\n4. As explained by others in recent comments, the arbitrary data can be easily switched to any number of different formats, with format chosen based on intended effect. STAMPS have the intended effect of being unable to be removed, so you can expect those particular txs to adapt accordingly, if they need to. It has various unintended consequences -- It would make already-created STAMPS more valuable, as it makes their supply finite. It can cause new designs to be more disruptive, not less. It creates an inevitable cat and mouse game, where Bitcoin Core must waste its precious time and energy and other resources on a pointless virtue-signaling exercise, and in fact vice-signaling by trying to censor fee-paying txs.\n\n5. As @petertodd mentioned, this activity represents a minuscule less than 1% of the UTXO set, yet trying to stop it creates technical risk, as always exists with any change to Bitcoin, and for that reason alone is unwise and not justified.\n\n6. Various fear-mongering claims about the UTXO set are thrown around to artificially magnify the problem with scary words like \"bloat the UTXO set\" and \"increase RAM usage\", but these claims are false or misleading. -- As @achow101 said: \"With current usage, even with the bare multisig protocols, I don't think the effect on full nodes is particularly egregious. The UTXOs created for the arbitrary data are still small and bounded. I did a calculation a little while ago which suggested that the UTXO set growth due to bare multisigs is around a few MB. Compared to the rest of the UTXO set and the blockchain, that's nothing. All that means is that the storage required goes up by that amount. It doesn't have any effect on [RAM] memory usage, since there's a fixed amount of cache. If the UTXOs are never spent, then they won't be taking up any memory. -- @murchandamus has said: \"We load into the UTXO cache any UTXO that get referenced by transactions, and new UTXOs that get created. We flush the UTXO cache whenever it hits the limit, so UTXOs that haven’t been used in a long time are likely not in the RAM.\" and \"By default, Bitcoin Core limits the mempool datastructure to 300 MiB of memory (RAM).\" and \"When this limit is hit, nodes start to discard the transactions with the lowest \"descendant set feerate\", i.e. the sum of fees divided by the sum of sizes of the transactions and its descendant transactions, until they are below the limit.\" -- @evoskuil has said: \"The only necessary difference is prunability, as both must be retained for bootstrapping. Yet widespread pruning also isn’t good for bootstrapping, so really not an important distinction. Disk space is the cheapest computing resource. There is no good reason to be concerned about linear chain growth.\"\n\n7. Bitcoin's governance is not a democracy. It is not about who can vote more in favor vs. against, on Github. It is about achieving rough consensus, where the primary objective is the precautionary principle of \"do no harm\" (Bitcoin is a conservatively operated network, not \"move fast and break things\"), and thus where objections have to be properly addressed. If lack of consensus, then no change.\n\n8. Bitcoin Core developers do not control Bitcoin. Users, businesses, miners, etc. _choose_ which node implementation to run. If someone does not like Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core has no obligation to disregard its principles of (7), bow to pressure, and make changes. Bitcoin Core follows its principles and provides software to the market. It is a free market actor. The rest of the free market's actors then choose whether to accept that software, or fork it to create their own software to run.\n\n9. Uneconomic lower fee-rate txs that are priced out (by economically-viable higher fee-rate txs) are not entitled to be able to be made on L1 Bitcoin with its highest censorship-resistant assurances. L2 networks like LN exist to be able to handle txs with lower economic value (txs with lower fee-rate), by allowing to amortize the cost of the L1 fee across many L2 txs. Really low economic value txs like coffee payments arguably do not need L1's censorship resistance, and if for example they are not viable with L2 either due to fees, then arguably can use different layers: semi-decentralized federated networks like Liquid, or Fedimint, etc. Or, even non-decentralized custodial LN.\n\n10. The other realistic solution besides (9) is to focus on improving Bitcoin's L1 and L2 efficiency via consensus changes like CTV, for UTXO sharing to increase fee density and thus economic value of lower-value txs (to be better able to compete with higher-value economic txs), and to use CTV to be able to improve L2s like LN and Ark and Enigma.\n\n11. One possible way to deal with arbitrary data txs, at its root, is to break Ordinal Theory, iiuc. This requires a fork, such as if Bitcoin implements Confidential Transactions. This too will need consensus, but it at least offers something valuable to many, in exchange for the lost fees: privacy (by default?) on L1 Bitcoin.\n\nI realize the truth is often unpopular, and truth is a bitter pill to swallow sometimes when it conflicts with one's ego, but nothing (not even ego) is more important than truth and reality.",

In 2023, the free market already voted in favor of arbitrary data txs, with a total of 8,500 BTC paid in fees by arbitrary data buyers of block space to sellers of block space, which was more than 1/3 of total fees.\r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/11140618/297799679-feb639a8-4379-4f5d-ba82-841026127514.jpeg?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MDU2NTk4NjksIm5iZiI6MTcwNTY1OTU2OSwicGF0aCI6Ii8xMTE0MDYxOC8yOTc3OTk2NzktZmViNjM5YTgtNDM3OS00ZjVkLWJhODItODQxMDI2MTI3NTE0LmpwZWc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjQwMTE5JTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI0MDExOVQxMDE5MjlaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT1hNWZlZTFiZjczOTU4MThhNGFmZDBiOGExMWFjYjcwYzJiNGM5MWIxNDE2NTBjYjg4ZDZjM2NkOWMyM2JlNGU3JlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCZhY3Rvcl9pZD0wJmtleV9pZD0wJnJlcG9faWQ9MCJ9.Fd6Gp5HA4K2ftlE_16-8lKgtIjAPPdU48EpBGB2RsKE)\r\n> \r\n> Thus, any attempt to interfere carries obvious and severe risks and unintended consequences, for both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin:\r\n> \r\n> 1. It sends a message that Bitcoin Core is being political, by trying to interfere in free market activity on the network by censoring valid fee-paying txs. It also would not dissuade activity, rather it would invigorate the arbitrary data economy due to being able to credibly claim censorship attempt. Permissionlessness quality means Bitcoin users do not require permission, not from Bitcoin Core nor from any other. Bitcoin operates on financial incentives of free markets. We have already seen in 2023 that the arbitrary data economy was only motivated by attempts to restrict their activity. It created a counter-culture that seemed \"cool\", in a rebellious \"stick it to the man\" sense.\r\n> 2. The update to Bitcoin Core is very likely ineffective, just virtue signaling (which Bitcoin Core should not be in the business of doing, as it makes a mockery of Bitcoin Core to implement changes that lack efficacy), since to change the public mempool relay situation, you would need iirc 85-92% of nodes to update. This is very low probability, as a significant minority or more of nodes simply refuse to update, and others wait years before updating. Also, users of arbitrary data obviously have an incentive to respond by running nodes without the change.\r\n> 3. Even if (2) is resolved in a low probability scenario, the arbitrary data economy can simply and quickly stop using the public mempool relay, and switch to miners' private mempool relay, by sending txs directly to miners. (Remember, there is a very strong financial incentive to route around any attempted censorship by Bitcoin Core.) This splits the mempool into 2 pieces: public and decentralized vs. private and centralized. Even if miners made their own mempool public at some point, it would need to be trusted, cannot verify, which incentivizes miners to lie about the real state of the mempool to increase fees paid. Nothing about this is good. It can cause pressure to centralize mining.\r\n> 4. As explained by others in recent comments, the arbitrary data can be easily switched to any number of different formats, with format chosen based on intended effect. STAMPS have the intended effect of being unable to be removed, so you can expect those particular txs to adapt accordingly, if they need to. It has various unintended consequences -- It would make already-created STAMPS more valuable, as it makes their supply finite. It can cause new designs to be more disruptive, not less. It creates an inevitable cat and mouse game, where Bitcoin Core must waste its precious time and energy and other resources on a pointless virtue-signaling exercise, and in fact vice-signaling by trying to censor fee-paying txs.\r\n> 5. As @petertodd mentioned, this activity represents a minuscule less than 1% of the UTXO set, yet trying to stop it creates technical risk, as always exists with any change to Bitcoin, and for that reason alone is unwise and not justified.\r\n> 6. Various fear-mongering claims about the UTXO set are thrown around to artificially magnify the problem with scary words like \"bloat the UTXO set\" and \"increase RAM usage\", but these claims are false or misleading. -- As @achow101 said: \"With current usage, even with the bare multisig protocols, I don't think the effect on full nodes is particularly egregious. The UTXOs created for the arbitrary data are still small and bounded. I did a calculation a little while ago which suggested that the UTXO set growth due to bare multisigs is around a few MB. Compared to the rest of the UTXO set and the blockchain, that's nothing. All that means is that the storage required goes up by that amount. It doesn't have any effect on [RAM] memory usage, since there's a fixed amount of cache. If the UTXOs are never spent, then they won't be taking up any memory. -- @murchandamus has said: \"We load into the UTXO cache any UTXO that get referenced by transactions, and new UTXOs that get created. We flush the UTXO cache whenever it hits the limit, so UTXOs that haven’t been used in a long time are likely not in the RAM.\" and \"By default, Bitcoin Core limits the mempool datastructure to 300 MiB of memory (RAM).\" and \"When this limit is hit, nodes start to discard the transactions with the lowest \"descendant set feerate\", i.e. the sum of fees divided by the sum of sizes of the transactions and its descendant transactions, until they are below the limit.\" -- @evoskuil has said: \"The only necessary difference is prunability, as both must be retained for bootstrapping. Yet widespread pruning also isn’t good for bootstrapping, so really not an important distinction. Disk space is the cheapest computing resource. There is no good reason to be concerned about linear chain growth.\"\r\n> 7. Bitcoin's governance is not a democracy. It is not about who can vote more in favor vs. against, on Github. It is about achieving rough consensus, where the primary objective is the precautionary principle of \"do no harm\" (Bitcoin is a conservatively operated network, not \"move fast and break things\"), and thus where objections have to be properly addressed. If lack of consensus, then no change.\r\n> 8. Bitcoin Core developers do not control Bitcoin. Users, businesses, miners, etc. _choose_ which node implementation to run. If someone does not like Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core has no obligation to disregard its principles of (7), bow to pressure, and make changes. Bitcoin Core follows its principles and provides software to the market. It is a free market actor. The rest of the free market's actors then choose whether to accept that software, or fork it to create their own software to run.\r\n> 9. Uneconomic lower fee-rate txs that are priced out (by economically-viable higher fee-rate txs) are not entitled to be able to be made on L1 Bitcoin with its highest censorship-resistant assurances. L2 networks like LN exist to be able to handle txs with lower economic value (txs with lower fee-rate), by allowing to amortize the cost of the L1 fee across many L2 txs. Really low economic value txs like coffee payments arguably do not need L1's censorship resistance, and if for example they are not viable with L2 either due to fees, then arguably can use different layers: semi-decentralized federated networks like Liquid, or Fedimint, etc. Or, even non-decentralized custodial LN.\r\n> 10. The other realistic solution besides (9) is to focus on improving Bitcoin's L1 and L2 efficiency via consensus changes like CTV, for UTXO sharing to increase fee density and thus economic value of lower-value txs (to be better able to compete with higher-value economic txs), and to use CTV to be able to improve L2s like LN and Ark and Enigma.\r\n> 11. One possible way to deal with arbitrary data txs, at its root, is to break Ordinal Theory, iiuc. This requires a fork, such as if Bitcoin implements Confidential Transactions. This too will need consensus, but it at least offers something valuable to many, in exchange for the lost fees: privacy (by default?) on L1 Bitcoin.\r\n> \r\n> I realize the truth is often unpopular, and truth is a bitter pill to swallow sometimes when it conflicts with one's ego, but nothing (not even ego) is more important than truth and reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this view shows a twisted absolute ignorance of what Bitcoin is about. Different from \"crypto\", Bitcoin is not an \"all purpose DB\" neither a 'world computer'. Its scope must be instead, contrary to all the 10000 altcoining misconceptions, and be kept tyranically (Satoshi's used term on this) TINY. Fees in Bitcoin are one of the measures against arbitrary data dumping, and Satoshi mentioned 'OTHER THINGS' that he could do to actually FIGHT it, NOT by any means EVER accept such misuse out-of-scope passively, which ultimately destroys his true invention, which is NOT a \"crypto\" shi*coin \"project\".\r\n\r\nSo again, concept ACK.",

      "body": "> I think this view shows a twisted absolute ignorance of what Bitcoin is about. Different from \"crypto\", Bitcoin is not an \"all purpose DB\" neither a 'world computer'. Its scope must be instead, contrary to all the 10000 altcoining misconceptions, and be kept tyranically (Satoshi's used term on this) TINY. Fees in Bitcoin are one of the measures against arbitrary data dumping, and Satoshi mentioned 'OTHER THINGS' that he could do to actually FIGHT it, NOT by any means EVER accept such misuse out-of-scope passively, which ultimately destroys his true invention, which is NOT a \"crypto\" shi*coin \"project\".\r\n\r\nYou're certainly entitled to your opinion about \"what is bitcoin\". But, personally speaking, I'm not interested in having a religious conversation, where Satoshi is treated as God & his words from the white paper and forums are being quoted like scripture. I had enough of that last time around, during the block size civil war, with the bcashers. They behaved in a similar fashion, and were unable to deal with reality (instead dealt in ideology, based on cherry-picking what Satoshi said during how things worked in his time when ASICs were not really a thing and so on), and as a result became extremely radicalized and ended up forking off. Both then and now, I'm only interested in logic and reason, based on the reality of how bitcoin and bitcoin core works, bitcoin's incentive system, and so on, which is what I tried to provide in my fairly comprehensive rebuttal to this topic.",

Of course, one can question the effectiveness of the spam mitigation proposed in this PR, but it's pretty absurd trying to argue that this spam would not be an attack even though the attacker is bragging about his attack in interviews.\r\n\r\n@RobinLinus  Hi Robin, first of all, I really admire your work on Bitcoin, and creativity and apparent intelligence and original and independent thinking.\r\n\r\nAs far as bitcoin and its incentives are concerned, which the consensus code is based on, I think it's really important to emphasize that \"spam\" is best defined as something like: \"any uneconomic tx that pays a fee-rate low enough that it does not get confirmed by miners\". \"Spam\" cannot be arbitrarily defined, it needs a neutral definition to reflect that Bitcoin is a neutral system that doesn't moralize \"good\" and \"bad\" txs. If \"spam\" is arbitrarily defined to include certain tx types, yet there is economic incentive for miners to confirm those txs, then it creates an incentive to directly send those txs to the miners, and can weaken/break mempool fee estimation and further centralize mining (I talked about this in my longer post).\r\n\r\nre: justifying it as an attack based on what @mikeinspace said in the interview, did you listen to the rest of the interview? I did know of the part that you highlighted, but upon your bringing it to my attention again, I listened to the entire 40 minutes. Twice! Taken in context, my analysis is @mikeinspace was trolling or shitposting or something like that, and that those words should not be taken literally. Totally stupid for him to say what he said though, since I've talked to him over the years sometimes, and I never thought he actually wants to attack bitcoin, nor that he doesn't care about bitcoin. I think he cares, yet his words here were horribly chosen & just begging for people to misunderstand his intentions. Maybe he said it for free marketing (\"no publicity is bad publicity\" taken to the extreme)? I have no idea.\r\n\r\nSome context --\r\n\r\nRight before your quoted part: \r\n> \"With ordinals, they did it in a very responsible way. They put it in this witness data, so that no one would get upset about it. And what happened? Well everyone got upset about it, and they want to get rid of the inscriptions because it's terrible, and Luke is already putting together a filter, and they're going to discard all this stuff.\"\r\n\r\nRight after your quoted part: \r\n> \"So basically, the whole point of STAMPS is they're immutable, they're unprunable. If you want to do it the responsible way, you can do it the ordinals way, and Luke is going to wipe them all out, but STAMPS is going to be there forever.\"\r\n\r\nAt 20:00 or so: \r\n> \"During the block size war, Adam Back had a tweet where he was like 'Someday we'll be paying $100 bitcoin fees and that's a great thing'. Okay, so now we're creating this fee market for you, and everyone's upset. 'I can't get my tx through at 1 sat/vb', it's like what do you want here? Do you want this to grow? Do you want it to just you know go down the drain? We are bringing use cases to bitcoin, we are paying the fees. The fact that anyone has a problem with that is unfathomable to me. It's like, I don't get it. This is good for you. We're saving you. We're creating this fee market that you thought was going to happen just on its own. No, you have to create use cases for it to happen. It's not going to happen on its own.\"\r\n\r\nAt 22:00 or so: \r\n> \"The way I look at it is that even if you hate the use case, it's drawing dev mindshare to bitcoin, and they're building things, and other things will get built that are unrelated to STAMPS. But you're drawing developers, and how can that be a bad thing?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he says at some point that in exchange for unprunability, the downside of STAMPS is they are much more expensive, so assumed it was only going to be a niche market limited to CounterParty users (@mikeinspace has history with CounterParty, and uses some CounterParty infrastructure to make STAMPS work, instead of relying on Ordinal Theory, as I understand it), so its growth beyond that was a surprise to him. And that he asked others what they thought about the idea of STAMPS, and they said it was stupid, but he still thought it made some sense so he did it.",

      "body": "> MikeInSpace pontificating in a podcast to the tune of \"hey, I helped with the fee market/security budget thing\" is not a serious contribution to this discussion.\n\n@BitcoinMechanic Hello. There was more context than that. If the argument is to justify a change because this guy admitted to attacking bitcoin, yet that is based on a few cherry-picked horrendous lines out of a 40 minute podcast, that seems pretty silly. The goal should be to understand what he actually thinks.\n\n> Visions for future revenue for miners never required invoking a broadening of use cases for bitcoin's blockchain to become a more generic medium for data storage. Such usage of bitcoin has never been considered anything other than harmful and conversations that lead to OP_RETURN (a mechanism to at least mitigate some of the harm done by arbitrary data storage) were never sidetracked by people insisting otherwise.\n\nI got it, but that was 10-12ish years ago, in 2012-2014 or so. Times change. Gmax posted in 2017 that he was very happy that market activity produced fees > subsidy and explained his reasoning, yet in the 6+ years since then, fees have been pitiful and only spiked during short periods of bull markets... until 2023, when a new use case of gambling suddenly gained critical mass out of the blue. I know it's not an ideal way to get fees, but \"beggars can't be choosers\", right? Normal monetary use hasn't been able to do it.\n\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/11140618/f862b475-588b-485a-839f-49e9af82f824)\n\nWhoever disagrees with me on security (and I've talked to a lot of people) somehow just handwaves away the problem, assuming that any potential future security incident will surely only happen after mass monetary adoption whereby fees * price will be sufficiently high. Are we supposed to pretend that gmax was wrong and didn't know what he was talking about re: fees' importance even in 2017? \n\nOr is it about sticking to the assumptions made 10-12 years ago, even if it means potentially having sufficient security in x years, yet a security incident in x-1 years? Are we all OK with bitcoin's hard money narrative being seriously damaged, with confidence hurt, and people's life savings in bitcoin being jeopardized? I'd imagine not.\n\n> Further, prevention of UTXO bloat has been the justification for uncontroversial decisions in the past such as heavily discounting witness data and there is no room for discussion as to whether or not bloating the UTXO set is harmful or not. By consensus, it is.\n\nAgree that consensus currently agrees on this, via the witness discount. It doesn't change the logic of what I pointed out in my quotes of various Bitcoin Core devs re: UTXO bloat. People make various UTXO bloat claims that are unsupported, so that was aimed at clarifying, primarily the RAM point that is often cited. \n\nBut yes, I do sympathize much more with this change, than with the other thread's datacarrier change. \n\nI raised various other points in my post here though, one of the main ones being a concern that others raised in this thread before me too: mempool split as a result of this change, if the economic incentive for tokens impacted by this change is sufficiently high for txs to be routed directly to miners.\n",

In software development this means you are no longer building the \"[right product](https://www.mojotech.com/blog/building-the-right-product-vs-building-the-product-right/)\". The main use case is and always will be sound money. Not \"freedom\", \"cypherpunk system\", \"database\", or a \"marketplace\". This isn't your latest tech stack to build on. No go to AWS for that. Bitcoin is hard money first. In a world of fiat, that use case alone has the biggest demand over anything else. It is the entire reason it was created as . No amount of bells and whistles can compensate for it. If anything is stopping people from moving money it is by definition a denial of service. Very clear here.\r\nAnd yes @eragmus reputation matters when building trust.",

This means the tx has been accepted into your node's mempool and is being relayed (of course, it's probably already in your node's mempool, but bitcoind doesn't complain).\r\n6) Rebuild the current PR's branch (commit 8672721deb06e66854a085c9994e99c99160b8a1), install, and run.\r\n7) Run the same command as before (`bitcoin-cli sendrawtransaction <paste tx hex>`).\r\nThis time, the transaction is not accepted into your node's mempool, and this error message appears instead:\r\n```\r\nerror code: -26\r\nerror message:\r\nbare-multisig\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd say this confirms that this PR works as designed!",

Stamps are absolutely ravaging the UTXO set.\r\n> \r\n> what do we mean by ravaging?\r\n\r\n@moonsettler low-resource devices tend to struggle with IBD once the utxoset no longer fits in memory. My own experience with this comes from helping users sync Raspberry Pi 4 devices for a couple of years while working at Start9. (The Raspberry Pi is especially bad because the bridge connecting external USB disks to the CPU doesn't work very well.) Once you hit your max dbcache, the utxoset starts being stored on disk, and IBD slows to a crawl. I started actively discouraging users from trying the 4GB Pi about a year ago because it now takes over a month to do IBD on those devices, whereas IBD took only a few days when the utxoset fit entirely in memory. As for the 8GB Pi, I haven't tested it recently, but I'm guessing that since [the utxoset has doubled in size over the last year](https://statoshi.info/d/000000009/unspent-transaction-output-set?orgId=1&refresh=10m&from=now-1y&to=now&viewPanel=8), these devices too will soon start to become unviable.\r\n\r\nThe ballooning utxoset is a clear and present danger to bitcoin, as it is actively making it so that large numbers of low-resource computers can no longer sync the chain in a reasonable amount of time, which hurts decentralization in the long run. \r\n\r\n>afaik the biggest unnecessary bloater of the UTXO set is the stacks protocol.\r\n\r\nCan you elaborate on this? If there are other protocols that are bloating the UTXO set that are even worse, I think it's worth our time to look into seeing if such abuse can be mitigated. I'm currently unaware of how the stacks protocol is contributing to the problem.",

I am not familiar with the Counterparty protocol, so I might have gotten some points here wrong. The [Bitcoin Stamps](https://github.com/mikeinspace/stamps/blob/main/BitcoinStamps.md), which are mentioned throughout this pull request discussion, are built with Counterparty transactions. P2MS is one of three methods used by Counterparty to embed data. The other two documented and to an extent implemented methods are through OP_RETURN and [P2SH](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0006.md) transaction outputs. More recently there is also a [proposal](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0033.md) to enable data storage through P2WSH outputs. It seems likely that if p2ms transactions become difficult to broadcast, Counterparty would move to these wrapped data embedding methods with P2SH, or P2WSH.\r\n\r\nFrom the P2MS Inputs and Outputs statistics on [transactionfee.info](https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-and-outputs-p2ms/), it is apparent that hardly any of the P2MS outputs are ever consumed, even though the Counterparty protocol was designed in a way to allow this by using 1-of-N multisig. The 1-of-N multisig technique was also mentioned as a mitigating factor by llanwj in the original 2014 PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5231#issuecomment-62512163. It is now clear that this not an effective mechanism for cleaning up these data-laden outputs.\r\n\r\nI was unable to detect [paynym version 3](https://github.com/OpenBitcoinPrivacyProject/rfc/blob/master/obpp-05.mediawiki#user-content-Notification_Output) usage, though it is hard by design to form a good heuristic for them. I am not sure if there is a widely used implementation of it though. The https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28217#issuecomment-1666943944 Sparrow and Blue Wallet don't seem to be using version 3 (if they are, maybe someone could link the code?).\r\n\r\nNext to the data provided by [transactionfee.info](https://transactionfee.info/#inputs--outputs), I also checked for what I think \"monetary\" p2ms usage is. Again these are imperfect heuristics and I might have missed or wrongly classified some transactions. The heuristics I used disregard Counterparty outputs, as well as three other output patterns that seem to convey data and that I only found a couple of outputs each (outputs with consistent 1000 satoshi dust amounts, outputs alongside OP_RETURN outputs in the same transaction and dust amount outputs mixing compressed and uncompressed public keys). This seems to be the only \"monetary\" bare multisig transaction since block 800000: 01bb94bef0ee1f352531a367523f5ed318399f58e32cebf7ef57bae3946772a8. With this kind of volume support requests for migrating wallet setups and scripts to supported forms of multisig seem unlikely.\r\n\r\nI also agree with achow101's https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28217#issuecomment-1666620826 that the same could be done for P2PK outputs.",

It *started* with Inscriptions but is now primarily due to BRC-20 tokens.  A static dust limit of 3 sat /vByte fees makes zero sense anymore, when those fees have only been seen like for a hot second since the spam started a year ago... https://statoshi.info/d/000000009/unspent-transaction-output-set?orgId=1&refresh=10m&from=now-1y&to=now&viewPanel=8\r\n\r\nVariable dust limits are the way.  (if Tx < TxFee) {isDust = True;}\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE filters are necessary.  Let's all be honest about this.  We CAN identify the many problems, and we CAN create the many solutions to these problems.  The variable dust rate solution can even be modified to add parent & child Txs & TxFees together, I'm sure.  LN's peg to static dust rates should not be a Core problem... and should not be used as a basis for not solving Core's own problems.\r\n\r\nP.S. - This might seem \"off-topic\", but then that view would admit that this PR is not \"just a database where anything goes\".

Full RBF is relayed to mining pools even if its disabled in core by default. Some nodes peering with each other similarly could always be used for propogation.\r\n4. Stamps can move to other output types and continue to create dust outputs.",

Peers with other Bitcoin Libre Relay nodes via a service bit (similar to my full-RBF peering fork).\r\n2. Remove's Bitcoin Core's OP_Return limits.\r\n\r\nThe peering code is already sufficiently successful that multiple people have been able to get non-standard OP_Return outputs mined without interacting with miners directly. For example [6f660e9f1bbfcc8435593eb8ff70a501275ad6cdbaa536747bd9d55bdbeda65a](https://mempool.space/tx/6f660e9f1bbfcc8435593eb8ff70a501275ad6cdbaa536747bd9d55bdbeda65a) was mined by F2Pool, which has manually removed Bitcoin Core's op-return limits (F2Pool has also removed the limitation of one op-return per tx).\r\n\r\nIf Bitcoin Core merges this pull-req, I will be reverting it in future versions of Libre Relay. I'm sure that miners will continue to mine these transactions, and Libre Relay will make it easy to get them mined.",

      "body": "> Relevant to this discussion: I've started a Bitcoin Libre Relay fork, that among other things does the following:\n\n@petertodd Thank you so much, Peter.\n\nSome of us have made a series of (aligned with first principles reasoning, logic, bitcoin incentives and game theory) arguments, re: why this PR and other PRs of this nature: 1) do not make sense to achieve the goal (neither the original goal, nor the often-moved goalposts) + 2) can be counterproductive by having various negative effects. (i.e. the risk/reward of these PRs does not make sense.)\n\nUnfortunately, the response from some others has been to invoke wishful thinking or magical thinking (perhaps cognitive defensive mechanisms to avoid directly engaging the arguments, perhaps as they challenge deeply-held beliefs about how bitcoin really works & thus what bitcoin actually is & so it threatens egos).\n\nSo, I hope your excellent work finally puts to bed at least some of the critics, who need to be shown & cannot or will not otherwise understand (\"Some people need to be shown, not told\").\n\nCongrats on the release!",

That'll just make life more difficult for smaller miners and encourage the growth of out-of-band transaction submission mechanisms that only large miners can realistically profit from.\r\n\r\nWe'd all be better off focusing our energy on technical improvements like utreexo that make UTXO growth less of a concern, rather than constantly adjusting mempool policy to block the latest provocation.

      "body": "@petertodd \r\n\r\n>we should not try to filter out profitable transactions\r\n\r\nThat is not what I or I believe others wish to do. The concern is the circumnavigating around sensible restrictions on arbitrary data storage, not presence of a relatively high fee.\r\n\r\n >That'll just make life more difficult for smaller miners and encourage the growth of out-of-band transaction submission mechanisms\r\n\r\nThis is something that can only be offered by the larger pools which, as you point out can create centralization pressure. Historically miners and the network in general have rebuked pools engaging in behaviour widely considered harmful at the social level, regardless of profit. A prime example being Marapool abandoning \"OFAC compliant block(s)\". Another hypothetical scenario being a pool making a tonne of money agreeing to engage in a more overt attack - deliberately mining empty blocks for example. Saying \"hey, it's more profitable for the pool and therefore their miners\" ignores the inevitability of that pool collapsing.\r\n\r\nLarger point being, if a pool were to do this in an environment where the wider network was treating harmful usage (or as you call it \"profit-maximizing transactions\") for what they are and for what the [creators of them declare them to be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJV_-EFZshU&t=286s) the pool would likely suffer a tremendous loss in hashrate which would certainly not be worth risking for the pittance in extra fees.\r\n\r\n>We'd all be better off focusing our energy on technical improvements like utreexo that make UTXO growth less of a concern\r\n\r\nImprovements like utreexo and more trustless sharing of UTXOs while desirable, are not mutually exclusive with attempts to limit frivolous, provably unspendable bloat.\r\n\r\n>Provocation....is definitely part of their marketing.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem relevant beyond being a tacit admission that this stuff is not just \"profit-maximizing transactions\" but instead harmful and that simply the preferred \"solution\" is to ignore it in the hopes that the only thing sustaining it is outrage from those discussing how to mitigate the exploit.\r\n\r\nThis is wishful thinking. Zooming out, usage of the blockchain for unintended storage of data is trending in the wrong direction, and most likely due to the passive approach that is becoming increasingly intolerable given how trivial it is to implement new relay policies and how difficult it is to gain traction for new schemes that utilize new storage methods. Each \"provocation\" can take months and needs to achieve a certain threshold for it to become sustainable (i.e getting enough idiots to fall for the scam). Justifying to investors your latest circumnavigation of the data storage actually permitted by default policy becomes extremely difficult when you're proposing using a network that has demonstrated its hostility vs using another more logical choice - some altcoin that actually solicits this stuff.\r\n\r\nMore simply, watching exploitation of this sort in any other system and simply hoping it will stop of its own volition is not a serious approach and demonstrably isn't working.",

Transactions are just data. As long as miners are mining those transactions – and they will – you are going to eventually have that data on your node either way. Allowing it into your mempool rather than waiting for it to show up in a block is the most efficient way of processing that data due to compact blocks.\r\n\r\n> It seems like your objective in the comments section of this PR isn't really to NACK the PR, but rather to lobby for your personal libre-relay branch to get merged instead (https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/libre-relay-v26.0).

      "body": "@petertodd :  I would suggest you to pay more attention to how Utreexo will work. It may not be as easy to alleviate the problems of UTXO bloat as you think. It might be good for mobile phone nodes if it successfully bootstraps via bridge nodes, assuming that entire network can transition to that quickly and securely might be a very bad assumption. It will also come at the cost of increased latency which you're often concerned about but conveniently ignore here.\r\nWe might have to do both i.e. worry about the current/future UTXO bloat and work on the Utreexo.\r\nI strongly request you to reconsider your position.",

Just so anyone understands better your reasoning, and not just myself? I promise I will not comment over it, but I think when you exclude any comment, not just specifically mine, you must leave it available in some \"moderated\" section like this one, as some people might want to read a different perspective from your 'moderation', and in some cases understand what is not allowed by your moderation. Does that make sense to you?\r\n> \r\n> Edit it into your earlier comment. Note that this is not permission to continue to make off topic and/or abusive posts. Every new comment sends a notification to everyone subscribed to this thread. Do not make further off topic or abusive posts - you will be blocked if you do so.\r\n\r\nYou keep warning me that I can get blocked, you can imagine that creates a situation that is unpleasant and threatening to someone on a first warning immediately, should not sound like a last one, right? So it seems important IMV that you show the original comment I did.  I am not wanting to contribute meanwhile, until I understand HOW can I, what was all that deletion and reasoning of yours all about, I would like to understand, and probably others also. What I am suggesting, w/o adding any more comments, is that you move moderated comments in this PR and maybe others also, reasonably to this 'excluded' section, so anyone can understand your reasoning for excluding. Currently I and anyone can only see your reasoning to delete my unknown comment.",

The Bitcoin users (node operators) should be in charge and establish their node's policies actively.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\nwith version 26.0 we now have the ability to activate v2 transport Protocol, which is a great improvement for Bitcoin.\r\nIn order to do that, the users need to set the flag v2transport to true. So the default setting is false, and this is correct.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the default for bare multisig is true, even if they have been overcome by BIP16, so the user has to manually switch to false to disable this feature. This is not coherent.\r\n\r\nSo, the users should have always the ability to activate such features by changing the nodes' policies, but the default status should be false.\r\n\r\nACK.",

      "body": "I think the discussion on this PR is so spirited because it speaks to a more fundamental question of how to make changes to the bitcoin network. Please let me know if there is a more appropriate forum for this discussion, I'm happy to take this elsewhere.\r\n\r\n> @chrisguida Let me expand on my NACK: given how easy it is for miners to adopt profit-maximizing transaction policies, and how easy it is for people to relay profit-maximizing transactions to them, we should not try to filter out profitable transactions. That'll just make life more difficult for smaller miners and encourage the growth of out-of-band transaction submission mechanisms that only large miners can realistically profit from.\r\n\r\n@petertodd Thanks for the clarification... this is a totally different point from your original nack, but let's address it as well.\r\n\r\nI've heard similar arguments from many people, and I have to say I disagree. The miners need to follow the will of the users (especially the holders), or bitcoin cannot survive long-term. Mining pools are highly attuned to short-term interests, generally at the expense of long-term considerations. This is understandable given the competitive and unpredictable nature of proof-of-work pooled mining. A pool operator who tries to be a good citizen and caretake bitcoin's long-term interests will most likely find itself at an economic disadvantage with respect to other mining pools (unless a majority of the hashrate agrees to the new behavior). So they *must* heed the will of the user community when the users express preferences, because this is the only way for miners to protect everyone's (including their own!) long-term interests. That is, the miners need us to tell them what we think is best for bitcoin's long-term health, and they need to trust our judgment on this, except in extreme circumstances.\r\n\r\nMany miners, of course, are users themselves, and of course they don't want to see bitcoin's blocks polluted with such a high volume of spam that it starts to drown out real monetary use cases, nor are they interested in seeing bitcoin's utxoset ballooning so rapidly in size that it prices most individuals out from ever being able to run and use their own node. Almost no one that I've talked to thinks the spam is a good thing. Even the people who disagree with changing the default mempool policy mostly agree that the spam is bad and if something could be done about it, they'd be all for it.\r\n\r\nThe crazy thing is, it's very easy for us to do something about it. All we need to do is find our voice as a user community and state our preferences loudly and clearly. The default mempool policy in bitcoin core is historically how we have achieved this, because it's the supermajority client of choice, and its default policy is unambiguous and impossible to misinterpret. It is our voice. Right now, that voice is telling miners \"hey, it's fine if you confirm spammy transactions, we don't care.\" This is incorrect. Again, almost no one I've talked to thinks that the spam is a good thing. We'd all prefer for the miners to help us rate limit this type of abuse if they can, because that's good for everyone. So when our voice is saying that it's okay for miners to confirm abusive transactions, our voice is lying. Not only that, but the longer we lie, the more difficult it will be for us to justify a reversal in our position later.\r\n\r\nGenerally when you have a dispute with someone, the first thing you do is describe how you would like the other party to change their behavior and politely request that they do so. Often, it's no inconvenience to them, and so they immediately comply (unless they are a psychopath). In case they _are_ inconvenienced by this, a negotiation can ensue. As long as both parties keep each other's interests in mind, it's usually fairly straightforward to arrive at an arrangement that is mutually beneficial (again, unless one party is a bad actor).\r\n\r\nIf a mutually beneficial arrangement cannot be arrived at, _then_ you start using threats of force, and then if that doesn't work, you actually use force.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of people I've talked to who are against changing the default mempool policy _are_ in support of some kind of soft fork to invalidate blocks that don't filter sufficiently, once the spam gets bad enough, because \"a consensus change is the only thing that will be effective\". This position is incoherent. This is tantamount to suggesting that, if someone harms you in some way (whether they are aware of the harm or not), you should just stay silent and allow them to continue harming you until you can't take it anymore, and then suddenly you punch them in the face out of the blue. This is the _worst possible_ strategy, as it almost certainly leads to a long, drawn-out, mutually destructive conflict, when you could have just said \"hey, can you stop that?\" right at the beginning, and that probably would have been the end of it.\r\n\r\nOnce we make our preferences known in a polite and unambiguous way, I expect the miners to simply comply with our request, as this is in everyone's long-term interests, _including theirs_. Again, the only reason the miners would ignore a clear and polite request from the user community and run their own clients instead is if they are bad actors who don't care about the long-term success of bitcoin. I don't think mining pool operators are bad actors. But if they are, we can only find out _after_ communicating our preferences, by watching how they react. Mining pools can't read our minds, nor can they safely concern themselves with bitcoin's long-term success without support from the user community, and _we_ are bad actors if we expect them to.\r\n\r\nMerging this PR will send a clear signal to the mining community that we do not approve of these spam transactions and would like them to be rate-limited. Yes, of course mining pools may choose to mine a nonstandard transaction here and there, and that's fine; the purpose is not to _totally ban_ such transactions; the purpose is only to reduce harm to users who are trying to use bitcoin as money, the way it was intended.\r\n\r\nSo, let's stop lying and merge this PR, now. In all probability, the miners will be happy to oblige, as their success and bitcoin's success are intertwined. They will likely be relieved and maybe even grateful since this will allow miners to stop hurting bitcoin and start helping, without giving an asymmetric advantage to any one mining pool refusing to filter these profitable but harmful transactions. (As @BitcoinMechanic pointed out, hashing operators abandon hostile pools very quickly). The miners themselves have likely been feeling anxiety over our mixed messaging, and worrying about potentially repeating the events of 2017, which didn't go well for the mining pools who chose to be hostile. I doubt anyone is eager to repeat the events of 2017, but we can and will if that's what it comes to. But again, I don't think this is at all necessary or likely.\r\n\r\nThe default mempool policy is our voice. It's time for us to speak.\r\n",

If that argument was robust, we would not need the blocksize limit.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if your argument was correct, miners would already be setting `-permitbaremultisig=0`. Other than Ocean, I'm not aware of any miner who does that. Meanwhile my own campaign to get miners to set `-mempoolfullrbf=1`, a setting that earns them more money in the short term, *has* succeeded: now that Foundry USA has turned on full-rbf, roughly 70% of hash power is mining it even though Bitcoin Core defaults it to off.\r\n\r\n> The crazy thing is, it's very easy for us to do something about it.\r\n\r\nIt's not. As long as miners are uninterested in setting `-permitbaremultisig=0`, changing this default in Bitcoin Core will just fuel the growth of alternative transaction relay mechanisms. Heck, we've *already* seen this happen with full-RBF, as it needed my full-RBF peering fork to reliably get full-RBF replacements to get to miners, particularly initially.\r\n\r\n> If a mutually beneficial arrangement cannot be arrived at, _then_ you start using threats of force, and then if that doesn't work, you actually use force.\r\n\r\nThat you are describing this change as \"force\" is exactly why so many people call this censorship: you are trying to prevent transactions from getting to miners who would happily mine them.\r\n\r\nI would strongly suggest that rather going down this path, you first convince more hash power to set `-permitbaremultisig=0`. You'd have a much better argument if, say, a majority of hash power wasn't mining those transactions.",

More credibly so because - again - we'd be taking advantage of only having to work with a tiny group of people.\r\n\r\n>Full-RBF earns miners more money\r\n\r\nTrue, but that is not the sole reason for its adoption. It also is good for bitcoin generally - as is minimizing non-monetary use of the blockchain and egregious bloating of the UTXO set.\r\n\r\n>Full-RBF routes around network defaults too.\r\n\r\nAgreed, I don't think you understood what I wrote there.\r\n\r\n>The real difference here is you are trying to prevent miners from getting data they want to learn about, censorship. Full-RBF and Libre Relay does the opposite: it helps miners learn about data they're interested in mining.\r\n\r\nAs a node, I am not placed under some obligation to provide miners with TXs they are interested in for fear that if I do not  they will start soliciting transactions out-of-band. Clearly the case which is why pools generally respect not just consensus, but standard policy also.\r\n\r\nThis has been a fundamental misunderstanding that has permeated the general discourse in conversations on this topic. Miners must not operate in a fashion that harms the network as indicated by nodes.\r\n\r\nIf you do not understand this then you have no defence in scenarios where miners are making money but acting maliciously in order to do so.\r\n\r\nIf the network cannot assert itself in such a scenario (which is incidentally exactly the scenario we are in) then that ultimately hurts miners too for obvious reasons.\r\n",

      "body": "@petertodd You appear not to have read my message at all. I'm used to your arguments being well reasoned, so this low-effort response is quite disappointing.\r\n\r\n> You're basically making an argument to altruism.\r\n\r\nNo, I'm not. I'm appealing to long-term self-interest for all involved. Altruism involves accepting harm to oneself so that others may benefit. Following a default mempool policy of `permitbaremultisig=0` would involve miners sacrificing _short-term profits_ in order to boost _long-term profits_. Please note that, on the contrary, what _you_ are suggesting involves altruism on the part of the user community, as putting up with the spam harms the users' ability to use bitcoin as money, so that miners can continue senselessly packing blocks with garbage to bolster their short-term profits (but hurting their long-term profits). I don't think anyone needs to sacrifice themselves for anyone else here. We can all benefit if we work together.\r\n\r\n>If that argument was robust, we would not need the blocksize limit.\r\n\r\nYou're proving my point again. I'm sure you haven't forgotten this, but the miners tried to hardfork to a larger blocksize limit in 2017 in order to bolster short-term profits; luckily, the user community was there to stop them. The block size limit exists to make sure that miners don't let short-term profits get in the way of bitcoin's long-term survival. The default mempool policy serves a similar purpose. Can miners circumvent these limits? Absolutely, but there are harsh consequences, and ultimately miners' interests are much better served by simply playing by the rules.\r\n\r\n> Secondly, if your argument was correct, miners would already be setting `-permitbaremultisig=0`.\r\n\r\nNo, they wouldn't xD. You did not read my message. Please note this part:\r\n\r\n>Mining pools are highly attuned to short-term interests, generally at the expense of long-term considerations. This is understandable given the competitive and unpredictable nature of proof-of-work pooled mining. **A pool operator who tries to be a good citizen and caretake bitcoin's long-term interests will most likely find itself at an economic disadvantage with respect to other mining pools (unless a majority of the hashrate agrees to the new behavior).**\r\n\r\nAnd this part:\r\n\r\n>Mining pools can't read our minds, nor can they safely concern themselves with bitcoin's long-term success without support from the user community, and we are bad actors if we expect them to.\r\n\r\nAnd this part:\r\n\r\n>this will allow miners to stop hurting bitcoin and start helping, without giving an asymmetric advantage to any one mining pool refusing to filter these profitable but harmful transactions.\r\n\r\nI said it _three times_ but still somehow you missed it, so I'll say it a fourth time: **_without support from the user community or a majority of hashrate_, miners cannot be good citizens and caretake bitcoin's long-term survival without extreme risk to their businesses.** Given this, it is not surprising _in the least_ that almost no miners have chosen to set `permitbaremultisig` to a value different from Core's default.\r\n\r\n>Other than Ocean, I'm not aware of any miner who does that. \r\n\r\nExactly. Ocean Mining is taking a huge risk by trying to do the right thing, as this likely puts them at an economic disadvantage versus their competition, at least in the short term. They are the only mining pool that appears to be playing the long game, and should be commended for their efforts to steer bitcoin in the right direction. For the record, Ocean has three different templates, only one of which disables p2ms.\r\n\r\n>Meanwhile my own campaign to get miners to set `-mempoolfullrbf=1`, a setting that earns them more money in the short term, _has_ succeeded: now that Foundry USA has turned on full-rbf, roughly 70% of hash power is mining it even though Bitcoin Core defaults it to off.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why you think campaigning to help miners increase their short-term profits is relevant to the current conversation. I hope you can see that `mempoolfullrbf` is entirely different from `permitbaremultisig` because it allows any miner activating it to have an asymmetric _advantage_ over those running the core defaults since rbf transactions, by definition, include a higher fee than txs they replace, and almost no one is hostile to fullrbf (because it's not harmful), and if they were, there would not even be a way to disable it via consensus rules. Personally, I'm with you on `mempoolfullrbf`; it honestly makes no sense that it's not enabled by default in core. But that's a separate conversation.\r\n\r\nConversely, with `permitbaremultisig`, any miner disabling it is not only going against the user community's stated wishes, but it is also forgoing a marginal amount of short-term profits from abusive txs that exploit this vector. So that's a double-whammy, whereas with `mempoolfullrbf`, going against the user community is only a single-whammy. So, of course lobbying for miners to increase their short-term profits (without support from the user community) will succeed, while lobbying for miners to _decrease_ their short-term profits (without support from the user community) will obviously fail. Make sense?\r\n\r\n(In both cases, the user community is misrepresenting its preferences and this should be rectified.)\r\n \r\n> > The crazy thing is, it's very easy for us to do something about it.\r\n> \r\n> It's not. As long as miners are uninterested in setting `-permitbaremultisig=0`, changing this default in Bitcoin Core will just fuel the growth of alternative transaction relay mechanisms.\r\n\r\nPeter, you really missed my entire argument, didn't you? Maybe my comment was too long? Anyway the gist is that we should not _automatically assume without evidence that miners are hostile_, wait until the spam gets so bad that bitcoin no longer functions as money, then suddenly blindside the miners with a fork. This makes _us_ the bad actors. Instead, we should first try reasoning with them like adults, by way of the default policy. If they ignore our _completely reasonable and mutually beneficial request_, then we can consider them hostile and take appropriate action. I see no reason to think that miners would not simply be rational and comply with our request. Yes, it may harm their profits in the short term, but at least no mining pool will have an advantage over any other in this regard. And furthermore, in the long term, bitcoin can continue experiencing healthy growth and functioning properly as the internet's preferred money, which of course all non-hostile miners want anyway.\r\n\r\n>Heck, we've _already_ seen this happen with full-RBF, as it needed my full-RBF peering fork to reliably get full-RBF replacements to get to miners, particularly initially.\r\n\r\nYes. See my above comment above on fullrbf. That is a different situation.\r\n\r\n> > If a mutually beneficial arrangement cannot be arrived at, _then_ you start using threats of force, and then if that doesn't work, you actually use force.\r\n> \r\n> That you are describing this change as \"force\" is exactly why so many people call this censorship: you are trying to prevent transactions from getting to miners who would happily mine them.\r\n\r\nThis is the _exact opposite_ of what I said. Please re-read my comment until it sinks in. I'm _specifically not_ calling this change force. I'm calling it \"speaking\". Speech is not force. Did you read _any_ of my comment?\r\n\r\n> I would strongly suggest that rather going down this path, you first convince more hash power to set `-permitbaremultisig=0`. You'd have a much better argument if, say, a majority of hash power wasn't mining those transactions.\r\n\r\n\"Convincing more hash power to set `-permitbaremultisig=0`\" is _precisely what I'm doing right now_, by lobbying for this PR to be merged into bitcoin core. Sitting on our hands and pretending like the user community's voice carries no weight will certainly not change anything. I can't think of a more effective way to convince a large percentage of hashpower to disable p2ms. Can you?",

Default mempool policy can either exclude or include certain classes of transactions. Altering these defaults is defying the user community's explicitly stated wishes.\r\n \r\n>Ocean is a good example of following a different mempool policy for some templates which **excludes** some transactions. Although it seems irrational but the pool may continue to work at least for a few years.\r\n\r\nI expect Ocean to last a long time because they appear to be actually concerned with the long-term viability of bitcoin, and users do mostly seem to think the transactions they filter are harmful, with the possible exception of some types of transactions from Samourai, which as I understand was not intentional on Ocean's part. I hope they are working on a solution to this. Anyway, this won't be relevant if they succeed in delegating template creation to their hashing operators.\r\n\r\n>The kind of tracking US government is doing for [locating miners](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364) raises some concerns about regulations.

It's a different way to use money(bitcoin) that some people do not agree with and follows consensus rules.\r\n\r\nI'm curious: what _would_ you consider spam, or an inappropriate/abusive use of bitcoin? Are you really trying to say that no amount of non-monetary usage of bitcoin is inappropriate? If 100% of transactions are for storing data on-chain, while 0% are for sending money, would you not consider that abuse?\r\n\r\n>An alternative way to convince miners to **exclude** some transactions would be to use `permitbaremultisig=0` for your nodes, document arguments for/against and contact mining pools directly.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly not a serious suggestion. My node, by itself, has no influence on what gets mined, and it's very unlikely that any mining pool would volunteer to forgo short term profits if no other mining pools were doing this, and the user community was explicitly saying \"sure, go ahead it's fine, mine the spam\" as our default policy is doing currently. Again, Ocean is a special case because they committed from the start not to mine spam.\r\n\r\n> Note: Some mining pools use bitcoin core with patches and don't mind changing default policies if it maximizes fees, no security issues etc.\r\n\r\nRight, and what I'm saying is that, insofar as the default mempool policy is an accurate reflection of the user community's wishes, mining pools altering it for short-term gain can be seen as a hostile move, and should be dealt with as such. Since the current default policy is not an accurate reflection of our preferences, this damages miners' respect for the user community and makes them much more likely to just do whatever they prefer, which, as explained above, can only result in short-term interests becoming increasingly dominant over time.",

It's a terrible precedent to say \"oh, scam token protocols are using some old tx format that no one uses anymore because it's extremely inefficient, but we can't disable it because the scammers are paying miners tx fees\". Following that precedent to its logical conclusion, bitcoin will eventually become *only* scam token protocols because gullible \"investors\" can always afford much more in miner fees than legitimate users if they think their $100 tx fee will lead to their scam token attaining a value of $1M someday.\r\n\r\nAlso,\r\n\r\n>If we change the default, we'll therefore likely end up degrading compact block relay, as miners would still be incentivised to mine these transactions while (presumably) most of the network wouldn't change the default.\r\n\r\n...the dust filter works exactly as you describe, and yet miners do not mine dust transactions very often. This is because demand for scam token protocols that use dust has diminished practically to zero, because of the filters bitcoin core implemented years ago to mitigate this abuse. It's a fallacy, easily contradicted by history, to assume that demand for such protocols will remain strong as the price of confirming their transactions skyrockets due to proper filtering.",

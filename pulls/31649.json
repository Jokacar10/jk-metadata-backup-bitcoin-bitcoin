    "body": "The headers presync logic (only downloading headers that lead to a chain with sufficient work) should be enough to prevent memory DoS using low-work headers. Therefore, we no longer have any use for checkpoints.\r\n\r\nAll checkpoints and checkpoint logic are removed in a single commit, to make it easy to revert if necessary.\r\n\r\nSome previous discussion can be found in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25725. The conclusion at the time was that more testing of the presync logic was needed. Now that we have [unit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/headers_sync_chainwork_tests.cpp), [functional](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/test/functional/p2p_headers_sync_with_minchainwork.py), and [fuzz](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/fuzz/p2p_headers_presync.cpp) tests for this logic, it seems safe to move forward with checkpoint removal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Therefore it is reasonable to remove them, especially considering the testing the pre-sync has undergone and the amount of time that has passed.\r\n\r\nEven under the assumption that there is a bug in the headers pre-sync logic (i.e. it's somehow still possible to submit low work headers), the checkpoints only raise the cost of attack slightly to an ever shrinking fraction of the cost of mining a block at the tip (see https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/09/18/disclose-headers-oom/).\r\n\r\nIf we are not comfortable with removing the checkpoints, then more of them should be added, as the protections they provide will converge towards zero otherwise.\r\n\r\nPhilosophically it is nice to get rid of the checkpoints, as they are one of the only things in this code base that dictate what the canonical chain is, which isn't a position we want to be in (this concern was also part of the design considerations for features such as assumevalid and assumeutxo).\r\n\r\nI think we could reasonably ship this removal in v29.0, as I don't see what additional assurances waiting even longer would give us.

With the headers sync logic, iiuc, it would be fine for our node in IBD to respond to GETHEADERS because the only headers we could have would belong to a chain with enough work. There isn't a risk anymore of sending a bogus chain to a peer and getting disconnected.\r\n\r\nThis behavior was first introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6172 and then changed to `MinimumChainWork()` in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24178. Some more discussion can be found in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21106#issuecomment-783676898 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21106#issuecomment-790802591.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's something I'm missing here, wrt to the logic of why it can be safely removed. If we do keep it, then I should at least update the comment (to explain why the check is still there?).",

So I don't think it's a necessity to keep the check for the purpose of preventing being disconnected by checkpoint-enabled nodes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there seems to be little reason not to do the check. It's cheap, and it doesn't seem unreasonable to avoid offering peers to sync from us before we're at a point where we can offer enough that we'd accept it ourselves, like @Sjors points out.\r\n\r\nI'd vote to keep it, but update the comments.",

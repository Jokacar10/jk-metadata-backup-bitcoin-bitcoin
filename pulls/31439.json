    "body": "If a user interrupts a reindex while it is iterating over the block files, it will continue to reindex with the next node start (if the `-reindex` arg is dropped, otherwise it will start reindexing from scratch).\r\nHowever, due to an early call to `ActivateBestChainState()` that only exists to connect the genesis block during \r\nthe original `-reindex`, it wil start connecting blocks immediately before having iterated through all block files.\r\nBecause later headers above the minchainwork threshold won't be loaded in this case, `-assumevalid` will not \r\nbe applied and the process is much slower due to script validation being done.\r\n\r\nFix this by only calling `ActivateBestChainState()` here if Genesis is not connected yet (equivalent to `ActiveHeight() == -1`).\r\nAlso simplify this spot by only doing this for the active chainstate instead of looping over all chainstates (first commit).\r\n\r\nThis issue was discussed in the thread below https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31346#discussion_r1856824817, the impact on assumevalid was found by l0rinc.\r\n\r\nThe fix can be tested by manually aborting a `-reindex` e.g. on signet and observing in the debug log the order in which blockfiles are indexed / blocks are connected with this branch vs master.",

      "body": "@mzumsande, do you happen to know why setting `assumevalid` to [block 859999](https://mempool.space/block/0000000000000000000196a7111c7aa3368af5a803a81c7bfb32860100dfd9c7) works as expected (it is found in the `860001` blocks in [`m_blockman.m_block_index`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L2496)), so it's correctly disabling script verification, but setting it to [block 860002](https://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000020c0ad748d78767d986e881259ba6de0a6e62cf946cf1) (we're currently at `873543`) enables `fScriptChecks` from the very

      "body": "> @mzumsande, do you happen to know why setting `assumevalid` to [block 859999](https://mempool.space/block/0000000000000000000196a7111c7aa3368af5a803a81c7bfb32860100dfd9c7) works as expected (it is found in the `860001` blocks in [`m_blockman.m_block_index`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L2496)), so it's correctly disabling script verification, but setting it to [block 860002](https://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000020c0ad748d78767d986e881259ba6de0a6e62cf946cf1) (we're currently at `873543`) enables `fScriptChecks` from the very beginning for some reason (i.e. setting a later block results in having earlier validation).\r\n\r\nI can't reproduce this. Assuming it's not related to reindex, on an empty datadir after header sync, whether I start with \r\n`-assumevalid=\"0000000000000000000196a7111c7aa3368af5a803a81c7bfb32860100dfd9c7\"`\r\nor\r\n`-assumevalid=\"000000000000000000020c0ad748d78767d986e881259ba6de0a6e62cf946cf1\"`\r\n`fScriptChecks` is set to 0.\r\n\r\n> I have tested https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/570af7281e21d51852b706e891835758d3d7161f, did an IBD to a clean datadir, stopped the process at ~20k blocks, restarted it with a -reindex: m_blockman.m_block_index contains the previous 25921 blocks only, so m_chainman.AssumedValidBlock() is not found among them, so script validation gets turned on at height=1 (same behavior as on master).\r\n\r\nDid you do this on mainnet? That would be because `-reindex` deletes the block tree db, but you don't have the full blocks for most of the headers yet. So after reindexing all of the block files you have, you don't have the headers for later blocks, so assumevalid is not applied.\r\n\r\nThis is a general issue if you do reindex with a datadir that doesn't have blocks above the minchainwork threshold in it - this PR doesn't solve this.",

It feels weird that it is only activated in the first place during a fresh startup once `ImportBlocks` is called. It is also inconvenient for kernel users, since they need to manually call `ActivateBestChain` on startup (like done in `bitcoin-chainstate`). I wonder if it would be better to move loading it into load chainstate, for example like I did [here](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commit/c8540a33ba8dc60c5b4f88f7c6ff3ccd1739598a) (though that patch is pretty hacky with hardcoding the flat file position and making the registered validation interfaces miss the first notification and has some other implications).\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Concept ACK. These changes seem clearly better than current code, though the fix here seems like a workaround for a workaround for a workaround. IIUC, the original problem leading to this complexity was a crash in some code that assumed the genesis block existed, so a wait was added in #5243 to prevent that crash (first workaround instead of just making code handle the state and not crash). Then this wait apparently prevented gui from showing reindex progress so an ActivateBestChain call was added in #7917 to connect the genesis block and bypass the wait (second workaround, which can connect too many blocks after reindexing is interrupted or when -loadblock is used, leading to this bug). Now a third workaround is being implemented to prevent connecting too many blocks in the typical case when reindexing is interrupted and blocks are written in expected order with genesis first. But this is still a workaround, not a solid fix because other blocks besides the genesis block can still be connected in other cases.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like things would be simpler and more reliable if we could delete the wait and delete the ActivateBestChain call, but as long as they need to exist, this fix seems strictly better than the current code.\r\n\r\nAm wondering if there is some way to write a functional test for this PR. It'd be hard to write a test that interrupts reindexing at the right time, but maybe there could be a test that uses two -loadblock arguments to load the same blocks multiple times and makes sure all the blocks except the genesis blocks are only connected together at the very end.",

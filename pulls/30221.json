    "body": "Implements the idea discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29652#issuecomment-2010579484\r\n\r\nCurrently, `m_last_block_processed` and `m_last_block_processed_height` are not guaranteed to match the block locator stored in the wallet, nor do either of those fields actually represent the last block that the wallet is synced up to. This is confusing and unintuitive.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes those last block fields to be updated whenever the wallet makes a change to the db for new transaction state found in new blocks. Whenever a block is received that contains a transaction relevant to the wallet, the last block locator will now be written to disk. Furthermore, every block disconnection will now write an updated locator.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the locator is relatively recent and loading rescans are fairly quick in the event of unplanned shutdown, it is also now written every 144 blocks (~1 day). Additionally it is now written when the wallet is unloaded so that it is accurate when the wallet is loaded again.\r\n\r\nLastly, the `chainstateFlushed` notification in the wallet is changed to be a no-op. The best block locator record is no longer written when `chainstateFlushed` is received from the node since it should already be mostly up to date.",

      "body": "I'm not sure, but it seems like a potentially good thing to me that `last_block_processed` and BESTBLOCK are two distinct concepts.\r\n\r\nThe last block processed is the block that CWallet in-memory state has been synced to (particularly CWalletTx::m_state which includes mempool / abandoned information not serialized to disk).\r\n\r\nThe BESTBLOCK record is the last block whose data has been flushed to disk, that the wallet should begin syncing from next time it is reloaded.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the first commit ae3b8280a7dbb6cc87814ed97dbea5a122cf8215 could lead to a performance regression if it is writing the flushing the BESTBLOCK record on every single blockConnected event from the node. For example during reindexing it could write and sync the database each time a block is connected, even if the block is before the wallets birthday, or doesn't have any relevant transactions?\r\n\r\nI think it probably makes sense to write BESTBLOCK in a smarter way, and probably write it more frequently, but it seems unnecessary to have to write it every block, and it might be bad for performance now or make optimizations harder in the future.\r\n\r\nI'm also curious about the idea of saving height with the best block record. I could imagine this being useful, since IIRC parts of wallet loading are complicated by not knowing heights of transactions before the chain is attached, but it doesn't really seem like the height is used for much yet. Was this intended to be used by something else later?",

      "body": "The idea of saving heights is interesting to me because wallet code assumes it know block heights many places, but it doesn't actually store heights anywhere. So for example, if the wallet stored a mapping of block hashes to heights (or other block information) it might be useful for allowing the wallet to work in an offline mode or letting the wallet CLI tool have more capabilities. This is all pretty abstract though, so I'm not suggesting something specific.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps an easy solution to this is to just write the best block every 1000 blocks (or some other interval) when we are in IBD?\r\n\r\nYes but I think that just adds back the complexity you were trying to get rid of, in a form that seems worse than the status quo. If you implement that, the wallet will be back to tracking the last block processed separately from the best block written to the database. And now, instead of the node determining when data should be flushed to disk and having all wallets flush that data simultaneously, each wallet will have internal logic deciding when to flush. This would be more complicated, and could be worse for power consumption and performance if there are multiple wallets and flushes are happening more frequently at different times.\r\n\r\nI think overall this PR is doing some good things, but the goals seem either not clear, or not clearly good, so I wonder if maybe you could take these changes and make more targeted PRs for the things you want to achieve?\r\n\r\nOr, if this PR is definitely the direction you want to go, I'm happy to review it. I don't like some things it is doing, but overall I think it is a reasonable change.",

There could be a more \"pull-based\" approach where they are aligned when the user interacts with the wallet, similar to what I tried to do for the backup case in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30678.

      "body": "Concept ACK\r\n\r\nI verified that this would solve the issues from #31824, only looked at the first couple commits in detail so far.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the above discussion, I think that the concept of delayed flushing only makes sense if it applies to all relevant data for a given block connection /disconnection (which is the case for the indexes, for example). But when other changes to wallet txns are synced to disk immediately, it seems wrong to delay flushing the locator - this will lead to a mixed state where some relevant data is flushed and other data isn't, which will lead to issues such as the one above.\r\n\r\nAs for the point of IBD performance due to updating the locator at every block: Maybe this could be prevented by keeping track during block (dis)connection, if we did any other changes to the wallet db for this block. If nothing else needed changing ( wallet not affected by the block, only the locator would be updated) it should be safe to delay / skip the update.",

      "body": "I added a change to make sure that the most recent best block is written to disk on wallet unload. However, it seems like this uncovered some weirdness in the wallet unloading on shutdown. In particular, `StopWallets()` was being called before `UnloadWallets()` which I think is incorrect. I added a commit which flips this order, and it seems to work, although there may be side effects I have not discovered yet. This primarily affects BDB wallets as the shutdown for BDB wallets is much more involved and confusing due to the shared database environment. This is not an issue for SQLite.",

This change seems ok now that it is not writing to disk on every block, and there are some nice cleanups here.\r\n\r\nI think PR description should be rewritten to say what the benefits of this change are now that statements like \"This PR changes the those last block fields to actually be in sync with the record stored on disk.\" are no longer true.\r\n\r\nI guess my thoughts are:\r\n\r\n- I like all the small cleanups here making operations more explicit.\r\n- I like that `blockConnected` notification now calls `WriteBestBlock` to update the wallet locator whenever the block contains any relevant transactions. That seems like a clear win.\r\n- I think it's probably good that `blockDisconnected` notification calls `WriteBestBlock` every block. Might be a little cleaner to only do it when the wallet is actually updated like `blockConnected`, but doubt that matters.\r\n- Calling `WriteBestBlock` every 144 blocks seems like it might write too frequently during initial sync and not write frequently enough after that. Seems like it might be smarter to update the best block based on clock time like the rescan implementation, which seems to write it every 60 seconds.\r\n- I don't like not updating the best block when the `chainStateFlushed` notification is received. It seems nice to be able to tell a daemon to flush all its state to disk at once, and have some high level control over flushing for efficiency so each component is not just doing its own thing. But this is a theoretical objection because I don't think `chainStateFlushed` was a practically useful notification before, even though it could have been.\r\n\r\nOverall LGTM.",

Only change since last review is dropping extra wallet shutdown step, which seems like a nice simplification.\r\n\r\nPR description has also been updated and looks good. I did find last two paragraphs a little confusing because when it mentions \"last block\" fields and records it sounds might be referring to `m_last_block_processed` and `m_last_block_processed_height` some places where it's actually referring to the best block locator. Would maybe suggest:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR changes those last block fields to be updated whenever the wallet makes a change to the db for new transaction state found in new blocks. Whenever a block is received that contains a transaction relevant to the wallet, the last block locator will now be written to disk. Furthermore, every block disconnection will now write an updated locator.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the locator is relatively recent and loading rescans are fairly quick in the event of unplanned shutdown, it is also now written every 144 blocks (~1 day). Additionally it is now written when the wallet is unloaded so that it is accurate when the wallet is loaded again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCould also add \"The wallet locator is no longer written when a `chainstateFlushed` notification is received from the node, since it should already be mostly up to date\"",

If `UnloadWallets`, which deletes `CWallet` objects, is being called before `CloseWallets` (formerly `StopWallets`) then calling `CloseWallets` will have no effect because there are no wallets to call `CWallet::Close` on.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the thing this commit is really doing is *avoiding* calling `CWallet::Close` so that a new best block write added in `RemoveWallet` in following commit can work (commit \"wallet: Write best block record on unload\" (b48be4b17929e540b6c093fa868b8aca6e01266e).\r\n\r\nIf that's the goal I think I'd suggest just completely dropping the `CloseWallets` function and the  `~WalletLoaderImpl()` destructor. If calling `CWallet::Close` call explicitly is needed it could be done in `RemoveWallet`, but if this change is working, it seems like that was never actually necessary and could be skipped.",

However, this step is skipped by `unloadwallet`, and afaict, is mostly unnecessary. So I've gone ahead and removed it. Since BDB is going to be removed, I see no reason to try to preserve this behavior especially when the two methods of unloading differ.\r\n\r\nFor sqlite wallets, this makes no difference.",

    "body": "Implements the idea discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29652#issuecomment-2010579484\r\n\r\nCurrently, `m_last_block_processed` and `m_last_block_processed_height` are not guaranteed to match the block locator stored in the wallet, nor do either of those fields actually represent the last block that the wallet is synced up to. This is confusing and unintuitive.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the those last block fields to actually be in sync with the record stored on disk. This requires adding the block height to the `BESTBLOCK_NOMERKLE` record, which was done in a backwards compatible manner. Additionally, the issue with `chainStateFlushed` fixed in #29652 is also fixed here by removing `chainStateFlushed` entirely. The last block fields, now simply the best block, is updated for each `blockConnected` and `blockDisconnected` so that it does actually represent the block for which the wallet is synced up to.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to deal with, the best block fields are consolidated into a `BestBlock` struct which also has the serialization code with backwards compatibility.",

For example during reindexing it could write and sync the database each time a block is connected, even if the block is before the wallets birthday, or doesn't have any relevant transactions?\r\n\r\nI think it probably makes sense to write BESTBLOCK in a smarter way, and probably write it more frequently, but it seems unnecessary to have to write it every block, and it might be bad for performance now or make optimizations harder in the future.\r\n\r\nI'm also curious about the idea of saving height with the best block record. I could imagine this being useful, since IIRC parts of wallet loading are complicated by not knowing heights of transactions before the chain is attached, but it doesn't really seem like the height is used for much yet. Was this intended to be used by something else later?",

      "body": "The idea of saving heights is interesting to me because wallet code assumes it know block heights many places, but it doesn't actually store heights anywhere. So for example, if the wallet stored a mapping of block hashes to heights (or other block information) it might be useful for allowing the wallet to work in an offline mode or letting the wallet CLI tool have more capabilities. This is all pretty abstract though, so I'm not suggesting something specific.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps an easy solution to this is to just write the best block every 1000 blocks (or some other interval) when we are in IBD?\r\n\r\nYes but I think that just adds back the complexity you were trying to get rid of, in a form that seems worse than the status quo. If you implement that, the wallet will be back to tracking the last block processed separately from the best block written to the database. And now, instead of the node determining when data should be flushed to disk and having all wallets flush that data simultaneously, each wallet will have internal logic deciding when to flush. This would be more complicated, and could be worse for power consumption and performance if there are multiple wallets and flushes are happening more frequently at different times.\r\n\r\nI think overall this PR is doing some good things, but the goals seem either not clear, or not clearly good, so I wonder if maybe you could take these changes and make more targeted PRs for the things you want to achieve?\r\n\r\nOr, if this PR is definitely the direction you want to go, I'm happy to review it. I don't like some things it is doing, but overall I think it is a reasonable change.",

If the users don't notice it I guess these don't have to be the same at all times. There could be a more \"pull-based\" approach where they are aligned when the user interacts with the wallet, similar to what I tried to do for the backup case in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30678.

See CONTRIBUTING.md\n-->\n\n<!--\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\nsignificantly:\n\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\n  should accompany the change.\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\n  was fixed.\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\n  changes are usually rejected.\n-->\n\n<!--\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\npatches often sit for a long time.\n-->\n",

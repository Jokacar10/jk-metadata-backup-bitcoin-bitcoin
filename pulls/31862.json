    "body": "This change stresses that all ZMQ messages share the same structure and that they differ only in the format of the bodies. Previously this was not clear.\r\n\r\nFurther it removes the notion of endianness of 32-byte hashes, as it was misleading, and replaces it with the term 'reversed byte order' (as opposed to natural or normal byte order produced by hashing functions).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it states that ZMQ 32-byte hashes are in the same format as in RPC. Previously it incorrectly stated that the two were in different formats.\r\n\r\n[Rendered](https://github.com/jirijakes/bitcoin/blob/zmq-doc/doc/zmq.md).\r\n\r\nFixes #31856.",

But I also found the formatting and structure of the new section hard to parse (old section was also bad but it was a little simpler).  I couldn't even figure out what is was saying until I looked at the `zmq_send_multipart` call. So I would recommend making some more changes to try to clarify, and I left some suggestions below.",

Was also confused about why the first line only mentioned topics and now bodies but for some reason left off sequence numbers. And then even confused by extreme overloading of \"sequence\" to refer to zmq sequence numbers, mempool sequence numbers, and the literal `sequence` string making up the first part of these messages. \r\n\r\nWould recommend reorganizing to just show message struct up front, and save explanation for after. I also think it is important to use a consistent way of describing little endian numbers, and it would be good to describe sequence messages last since they are most confusing and complicated topic and overload the sequence number term that was just explained above. Would suggest:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe ZMQ messages that are sent look like the following, with topic strings, message bodies, and message sequence numbers in three parts:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    | rawtx     | <serialized transaction>                              | <4-byte LE uint sequence number> |\r\n    | hashtx    | <32-byte transaction hash, reversed>                  | <4-byte LE uint sequence number> |\r\n    | rawblock  | <serialized block>                                    | <4-byte LE uint sequence number> |\r\n    | hashblock | <32-byte block hash, reversed>                        | <4-byte LE uint sequence number> |\r\n    | sequence  | <32-byte block hash, reversed>C                       | <4-byte LE uint sequence number> |\r\n    | sequence  | <32-byte block hash, reversed>D                       | <4-byte LE uint sequence number> |\r\n    | sequence  | <32-byte transaction hash, reversed>R<8-byte LE uint> | <4-byte LE uint sequence number> |\r\n    | sequence  | <32-byte transaction hash, reversed>A<8-byte LE uint> | <4-byte LE uint sequence number> |\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the details about specific fields could be given below.",

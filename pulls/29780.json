Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer. Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+libbitcoinconsensus\n+-------------------\n+\n+- libbitcoinconsensus is deprecated and will be removed for v28. This library has\n+  existed for nearly 10 years with very little known uptake or impact. It has\n+  become a maintenance burden.\n+\n+  The underlying functionality does not change between versions, so any users of\n+  the library can continue to use the final release indefinitely, with the\n+  understanding that Taproot is its final consensus update.\n+\n+  In the future, libbitcoinkernel will provide a much more useful API that is\n+  aware of the UTXO set, and therefore be able to fully validate transactions and\n+  blocks. (#29189)\n+\n+mempool.dat compatibility\n+-------------------------\n+\n+- The `mempool.dat` file created by -persistmempool or the savemempool RPC will\n+  be written in a new format, which can not be read by previous software\n+  releases. To allow for a downgrade, a temporary setting `-persistmempoolv1` has\n+  been added to fall back to the legacy format. This new format includes the XOR'ing\n+  of transaction contents to mitigate issues where external programs (such as anti-virus)\n+  attempt to interpret and potentially modify the file.\n+\n+P2P and network changes\n+-----------------------\n+\n+- BIP324 v2 transport is now enabled by default. It remains possible to disable v2\n+  by running with `-v2transport=0`. (#29347)\n+- Manual connection options (`-connect`, `-addnode` and `-seednode`) will\n+  now follow `-v2transport` to connect with v2 by default. They will retry with\n+  v1 on failure. (#29058)\n+\n+- Network-adjusted time has been removed from consensus code. It is replaced\n+  with (unadjusted) system time. The warning for a large median time offset\n+  (70 minutes or more) is kept. This removes the implicit security assumption of\n+  requiring an honest majority of outbound peers, and increases the importance\n+  of the node operator ensuring their system time is (and stays) correct to not\n+  fall out of consensus with the network. (#28956)\n+\n+Mempool Policy Changes\n+----------------------\n+\n+- Opt in Topologically Restricted Until Confirmation (TRUC) Transactions policy\n+  (aka v3 transaction policy) is available for use on test networks only with\n+  `-acceptnonstdtxn=1`. By setting the transaction version number to 3, TRUC transactions\n+  request the application of limits on spending of their unconfirmed outputs. These\n+  restrictions simplify the assessment of incentive compatibility of accepting or\n+  replacing TRUC transactions, thus ensuring any replacements are more profitable for\n+  the node and making fee-bumping more reliable. TRUC transactions are currently\n+  nonstandard and can only be used on test networks where the standardness rules are\n+  relaxed or disabled (e.g. with `-acceptnonstdtxn=1`).\n+\n+External Signing\n+----------------\n+\n+- Support for external signing on Windows has been disabled. It will be re-enabled\n+  once the underlying dependency (Boost Process), has been replaced with a different\n+  library. (#28967)\n+\n+Updated RPCs\n+------------\n+\n+- The addnode RPC now follows the -v2transport option (now on by default, see above) for making connections.",

    "body": "These scripts are becoming more of nuisance, than a value-add; particularly since we've been building releases using Guix. Adding new (release bin) tests can be harder, because it requires constructing a failing test, which is becoming less easy, e.g trying to disable a feature or protection that has been built into the compiler/toolchain by default.\r\n\r\nIn the pre-Guix days, these were valuable to sanity-check the environment, because we were pulling that pre-built from Ubuntu, with little control. At this point, it's less clear what these scripts are (sanity) checking.\r\n\r\nNote that these also weren't completely ported to CMake (#31698), see also #31715 which contains other fixes that would be needed for these test-tests, to accomodate future changes.",

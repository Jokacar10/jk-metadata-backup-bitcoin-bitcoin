      "body": "> I like this, but is there a way to avoid reintroducing the mempool message transaction spying vulnerability? Construct the block skipping txn that have not yet been announced?\r\n\r\nEach template is [annotated](https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/blob/355e0b2665952c4c16d98a4212d1f74df8bf5263/src/net_processing.cpp#L5210) with the mempool's `GetSequence()` and a template [won't be presented](https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/blob/355e0b2665952c4c16d98a4212d1f74df8bf5263/src/net_processing.cpp#L4473-L4478) to a peer if its `m_last_inv_sequence` isn't at least that value. Since we announce the highest fee txs first when updating `m_last_in_sequence` that should mean they'll have already seen any txs in the template via INV (or implicitly via INV'ing a child/descendant).\r\n\r\nCurrently it will just immediately give an old template if the current template is too new; it would also be possible to delay providing the current template until `m_last_inv_sequence` is bumped when the next INV is sent, but that would have been a little more complicated and I wanted to keep things as simple as possible.\r\n\r\n> It may be hard to do that perfectly; for example, if a recent CPFP occurred that bumped a low-fee old parent up high enough to make it into the template, but the child has not been announced to the peer yet.\r\n\r\nI think the above should also take care of this case already.\r\n\r\nI guess that reveals a little more ordering info: if you received two high fee txs (tx1 and tx2) in a single INV cycle, but generate a new template after receiving tx1 but before receiving tx2, then you'll reveal the ordering of tx1 and tx2 to your peers. So perhaps aligning template generation with INV messages to inbound peers would be a worthwhile improvement. That would perhaps be a slightly leak to outbounds, but nothing they couldn't discover just by making an inbound connection to you.\r\n\r\n> What are your thoughts on the size of template, I don't think it makes sense to just limit them to being one block in size, perhaps it would be reasonable to be 2 blocks in size so it always can run one block ahead?\r\n\r\nThat seems pretty appealing; I didn't do anything along those lines here mostly to keep things simple, and because waiting for cluster mempool before building even bigger collections of packages seemed plausible. If miners were to enforce their own soft blocksize limits (perhaps to reduce blockchain growth and marginally improve IBD, or as a cartel-style way of limiting supply to push prices up), then a 4M weight template might already account for 2 or more blocks worth of transactions. (signet blocks are mostly limited to 1M weight, eg)\r\n\r\nA double-size block wouldn't give you an ideal predictor for the next block: it would miss timelocked transactions and transactions that exceed ancestor/descendant limits for a single block, though equally a sufficiently clever peer could just include those in a template anyway, especially if consensus/locktime checks weren't being performed. At least they could if they ever saw them in the first place, which is presumably doubtful.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what level of template overlap is likely in the real world -- if it's just \"everyone thinks these txs are valid, but some nodes don't think these are, and others don't think these other ones are\", maybe that just adds up to ~6MB of memory total across all your peers (even if there are simultaneous surges across both unusual types of transactions) plus maybe 15% to account for churn. On the other hand, at times there might conceivably be a lot of double spends in the top of varius mempools, (perhaps posted to the network by chainanalysis-type nodes in order to try to discover the p2p network's structure to help figure out where txs came from or which nodes are most likely to be building templates for mining). If that's the case, it might not be sensible to try to keep all your peers' conflicting template txs in memory, and I think there's probably a variety of different approaches that might be worth trying there.",

When they use only their mempool to build those templates, I don’t think that the transactions with diverging mempool policy will relay through the network and improve the compact block reconstruction process via this mechanism. Only peers whose outbound connections are miners will benefit.\r\n\r\n2. We don’t accept transactions in the mempool that have divergent policy because we deem them non-standard. How does this proposal prevent a scenario where an adversary stuff transactions that are harmful to peers, forcing them to validate and save them? (I think this is where weak blocks are superior to this proposal because they show that work has been done previously.)\r\n\r\n3. Is there a limit to the memory used to store the transactions that violate a node’s mempool policy but are received from peers? How do you decide which to keep and which to evict when the limit is reached?\r\nOne approach could be linearization based on incentive compatibility and then evicting low-fee transactions, although this has the drawback of then making us not saving transactions paid for via out-of-band.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> 1. How do nodes build the block template they share with peers?\r\n\r\nThe same way they build a block template for the `getblocktemplate` RPC (well, except ignoring config options that might otherwise reduce the block size). See [here](https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/blob/355e0b2665952c4c16d98a4212d1f74df8bf5263/src/net_processing.cpp#L5192-L5203).\r\n\r\n> When they use only their mempool to build those templates, I don’t think that the transactions with diverging mempool policy will relay through the network and improve the compact block reconstruction process via this mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't aim to improve tx relay in most cases. The scenario this helps with is when a subset of the network has a relaxed policy compared to your node (eg, the librerelay nodes on the network vs you; or the core nodes on the network vs a default knots node; or nodes that have adopted newer policy/replacement rules (eg TRUC, lower min fee, pay to anchor, etc) vs an older/non-enabled node). In that case, if you happen to peer with one of those nodes that have a relaxed policy, and you request templates from that node, you'll be able to reconstruct blocks mined with that relaxed policy without needing a round trip.\r\n\r\n(The main case where it might improve relay is when a tx was evicted from many but not all mempools due to size limits, but eventually mempools clear and its eligible again, but has not already been widely rebroadcast for other reasons. In some circumstances it also might help with replacement cycling attacks, allowing the victim transaction to automatically be rebroadcast once the conflicting tx has been replaced)\r\n\r\n> 2. We don’t accept transactions in the mempool that have divergent policy because we deem them non-standard. How does this proposal prevent a scenario where an adversary stuff transactions that are harmful to peers, forcing them to validate and save them?\r\n\r\nNote that this PR does not include code for requesting templates, only providing them; so there's no change here from this PR alone.\r\n\r\nThe proof of concept code linked from https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/sharing-block-templates/1906/ that does request templates grabs templates from outbound/manual peers, and validates any txs in templates that aren't in the mempool according to the usual standardness rules, adding them to the mempool if they pass. That's no more harmful (CPU-wise) than receiving the same txs via INV/GETDATA, and the memory usage is limited by only keeping one template per selected peer, and rejecting templates that are more than 1MvB.\r\n\r\nIf you were to validate txs in templates against consensus rules only (without the additional standardness rules), then that could be more costly (you'd be missing the tx size limit and BIP 54 rules so might be hitting significant amounts of hashing), though. The proof of concept code doesn't do that.\r\n\r\n> 3. Is there a limit to the memory used to store the transactions that violate a node’s mempool policy but are received from peers? How do you decide which to keep and which to evict when the limit is reached?\r\n>    One approach could be linearization based on incentive compatibility and then evicting low-fee transactions, although this has the drawback of then making us not saving transactions paid for via out-of-band.\r\n\r\nIf transactions in templates are ordered by (modified) fee rate, then you could keep the first transactions in a template, which might help you preserve transactions that were paid for out-of-band if you have a peer that's aware of the out-of-band payments. That could also work for things like mempool.space's accelerator product, where there's an API that will tell you about the prioritised transactions, provided a sufficient number of nodes use the API and prioritise transactions accordingly.",

      "body": "> Maybe a stupid question and I'm not understanding something, but what is the point of this if we have to wait for all transactions to be announced? Isn't the whole idea to make sure our peers know about what we think will be the next block?\r\n\r\nIf you include a transaction in a template you send to a peer, that implicitly announces the tx to that peer.\r\n\r\nThe reason we delay announcing txs to a peer is to add some uncertainty about when precisely we received a transaction, and the order in which we received similarly recent transactions -- knowing when many nodes in the network first heard about transactions with precision allows you to make a very good guess about how the network is structured and who heard about a transaction first, which makes it easier to work out who created the transaction which is bad for privacy, and possibly identify weak points in the p2p network to better plan DoS attacks.\r\n\r\nSo preserving the same timing uncertainty when adding a potentially new way to announce txs seems worthwhile.",

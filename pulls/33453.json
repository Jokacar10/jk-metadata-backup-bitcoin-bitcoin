    "body": "Removes the deprecation for the `datacarrier` and `datacarriersize` options by reverting commit 0b4048c73385166144d0b3e76beb9a2ac4cc1eca from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406\r\n\r\n**Many current Bitcoin Core users want to continue using this option**\r\nThis statement is based on public postings from many Bitcoin Core users and not a formal survey. AJ Towns’ observation from [#32406](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406/commits/0b4048c73385166144d0b3e76beb9a2ac4cc1eca#r2084024874) that “_for now there seem to be a bunch of users who like the option_” has only become more apparent in the months since.\r\n\r\n**The deprecation intent is unclear to users**\r\nThis echo’s Ava Chow’s comment from #32714 that “_IMO we should not have removal warnings if there is no current plan to actually remove them._” In months since that comment, partially due to increased feedback from Bitcoin Core users wanting to keep this option, there is even less likelihood of a near term plan to remove these options. That leaves Bitcoin Core users in an unclear situation: the option could be removed in the next version or perhaps never. Removing the deprecation gives clarity for their planning purposes. Deprecating the option in the future, preferably with a removal schedule to better inform users, would still be possible.\r\n\r\n**Minimal downsides to removing deprecation**\r\nAs a best practice, Bitcoin Core has avoided an option when the developers cannot articulate when they should be used. There is non-zero maintenance cost to keeping this code around (although leaving the options deprecated for a long time has the same effect). “Don’t offer users footguns” is also a good principle, but with this option, there seems to be only small impacts that can quickly be remedied by changing the option value by Bitcoin Core users. There already exist in Bitcoin Core more potentially-user-harmful options/values than what datacarrier might cause.\r\n",

      "body": "ACK 451ba9ada41f687c0e4bb34d5925374a68a8f8a3\r\n\r\nI don't think getting upset about the presence or absence of a deprecation note is sensible, so my ACK shouldn't be taken as an indication that I'll be upset if this PR isn't merged.\r\n\r\nThere were a few rationales given for deprecation, I think the strongest being:\r\n\r\n * the philosophy that \"all user options should either come with clear recommendations for how to use them or, if no recommendation can be made, they should not exist or be discouraged\" ([ref](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#issuecomment-2955614286))\r\n * the expectation that the option will be removed in the next release or shortly thereafter ([ref](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#discussion_r2088901333))\r\n\r\nAs far as the first point goes, I think we can actually make clear recommendations for when to use the datacarrier options:\r\n\r\n * if you wish to avoid including large OP_RETURN outputs in blocks you mine, then reducing the datacarriersize will allow you to do that\r\n * if you wish to be more strongly compatible with the 29.x and earlier relay policy, reducing the datacarriersize to 83 will get you most of the way there\r\n * if the new default policy causes unforseen problems, then reducing the datacarriersize may allow you to avoid/mitigate those problems without needing to deploy a new release of the software\r\n\r\nI think the latter two recommendations generalise fairly well, and thus that it's probably a bad idea to both change a configuration option's default and remove/deprecate that option at the same time.\r\n\r\nAs far as the first point goes, I don't believe a deprecation notice without a definitive removal timeline specified should be taken as an expectation that the option will be removed soon ([ref](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#issuecomment-2861778194), [ref](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#discussion_r2090119662)), and I don't believe there's any significant value in removing this option, as the maintenance cost for keeping it is extremely low.\r\n\r\nI wrote previously that \"the reason to recommend not using it is because it will likely harm the efficiency of block reconstruction, slowing down block relay\", but I don't think the effect there is particularly significant: with compact blocks working efficiently we expect blocks to be relayed across the network in perhaps 500ms (200ms one-way latency to the other side of the world, plus a couple of 150ms sets as nodes actually validate the block), which gives an implied orphan rate of about 0.08% or about 1 in 1250 blocks, which is pretty close to what we see. When compact block relay requires a request, that forces 1.5 round trips (tripling the latency versus the one-way value) so that may give a value from 900ms to 1500ms, with an implied orphan rate between 0.15% and 0.25%. If you're currently mining with an orphan rate of 0.08% then an orphan rate of 0.25% would be a decrease in revenue of 0.17%. For comparison, the difficulty increase from early May to now (given the same hashrate) implies a decrease in revenue of 19.5%, more than 100x as much. I think it makes sense to set defaults to maximise even small amounts of revenue, but that's a \"picking up pennies\" saving, not a \"small miners will be put out of business\" situation.",

      "body": "I think Bitcoin Core should strive to limit its extensive and growing number of startup options. Optionality for the sake of it is counterproductive. On this basis, the `-datacarrier` and `-datacarriersize` options controlling a long obsolete relay policy limit are in my opinion prime candidates for removal.\r\n\r\nThat said, certain users care strongly about using those options. In these conditions, i do not see the project removing the option anytime soon. Therefore i think it's technically incorrect (and confusing) to mark it as deprecated. utACK 451ba9ada41f687c0e4bb34d5925374a68a8f8a3 on removing the deprecation.\r\n\r\n> fwiw: If/when this is merged, the [draft release notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/v30.0-Release-Notes-Draft#policy) should be updated.\r\n\r\nWell, only if it gets backported to 30.0?",

Multiple OP_RETURN outputs are still allowed by this change, creating a situation where users cannot get the same behavior from their nodes' relay policy from previous versions through configuration.\r\n> \r\n> It's still a mystery to me why multiple OP_RETURNs are being allowed since an extra OP_RETURN costs at least 9 more vbytes and the same data can be stored in one OP_RETURN with some sort of (perhaps multi-byte) delimiter. Perhaps there are use-cases for multiple OP_RETURNs that can't be done in one OP_RETURN that I'm not aware of?\r\n\r\nyou can get the same behavior - use one op return. the data-carrier size with multiple op returns is the sum of the data across them. limiting number of op returns isn't protective, people who want to can create multiple transactions, which is higher overhead than one transaction with multiple op returns. obviously a single op return is lower overhead than multiple, but people can create multiple transactions too fi they want so it's not something logical to attempt to discourage with policy.",

IMHO if we want to build software that we consider good for the users, as we stated in the  [relay-policy post](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/06/06/relay-statement/), we should stay in that position and keep taking decisions based on what we think is the best and not for \"drama\" consequences.\r\n\r\nThe campaign against Core is big and a change like this can be seen as a \"we are not that bad\" and a try to make them stop complaining.\r\n\r\nThis change is clearly not enough for the users whose ultimate goal is to get the default value and behavior back. This PR will not change anything in that way, but it can give the message, to people who supported the change (and supported Core devs), that it may not be worth to support us next time because public pressure and FUD can easily change our minds. And anyway, because of what I mentioned already, the people who are complaining don't use Core and won't start using it after this change.\r\n\r\nI would prefer a PR improving the deprecation message to make it clear that we are discouraging the use of the option, but not planning to remove it (for the moment). Re-opening https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32714 with the deprecation message back sounds like a better idea to me.\r\n\r\nIf we consider that \"filtering\" transactions is bad, we must discourage doing it.",

      "body": "> Is the argument that poor compact block reconstruction rates leads to miner centralization overblown then if the loss in revenue due to orphans is dwarfed by the increasing difficulty? I thought this argument was one of the reasons for both uncapping `OP_RETURN` limits and for allowing sub-1sat/vb relay?\r\n\r\nThe comparison is that losing $1.70 out of every $1000 in revenue is effectively just noise or a rounding error in an environment where you're getting $195 swings due to other factors, so is unlikely to be a make-or-break effect. But that said, $1.70 is still better than $0 (or losing $193.50 is better than losing $195), so it's still worth trying to improve things. Over a year, 0.17% of revenue for a miner with 1% of global hashrate is $300k at current prices, for instance.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of compact block relay saw a much larger decrease in block relay times -- on the order of perhaps 6 seconds down to 0.5 seconds, which corresponds to implied orphan rates of 1% (one a day) reducing to 0.08% (one a week), so the saving there is closer to $10 out of every $1000, which is more impactful. But that change wasn't just due to avoiding round trips, but also due to reduced bandwidth usage, relaying after checking proof of work but before full validation, and other improvements in validation performance. So I think it makes sense that inefficiencies here don't take us all the way back to the bad old days of 2016, and we don't need to worry that every non-optimal in this area choice might have large centralizing effects.\r\n\r\nThe \"degrades compact block performance\" argument applies to any relay policy differences where there is significant number of txs that make use of the distinction; so likely applies to all of fullrbf, OP_RETURN, sub-1sat relay, TRUC, ephemeral anchors, and ancestor/cluster limits. It's potentially particularly strong for sub-1sat relay, since that often involves enough transactions that it not only adds a round-trip, but the amount of data that needs to be relayed for blocks that are mostly sub1sat may also become impactful, particularly for the first few listening peers to see the block that need to relay the block data to over 100 peers each.",

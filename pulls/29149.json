They are not foolproof, particularly to very targeted attacks. While it is concerning that the server was compromised in the past, there is no evidence that it continues to be compromised.\r\n\r\nAFAIK Luke has maintained control over it, continues to follow security best practices, and has not transferred the seed to anyone else. The seeder continues to behave honestly - it returns random nodes, and the vast majority of them also appear in bitcoin.sipa.be/seeds.txt.gz so can be reasonably assumed to be okay.",

I added two:\r\n- The first attempts to measure diversity by counting the [distinct number of versions](https://21.ninja/dns-seeds/node-version-count/)\r\n- The second is tailored specific for the issue at hand and shows the [version range](https://21.ninja/dns-seeds/node-version-range/)",

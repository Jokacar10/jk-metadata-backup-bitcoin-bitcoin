    "body": "This is another robustness fix that i [dropped](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31907#issuecomment-2698108727) from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31907, intending to just tweak the error in my branch which triggers the issue. As i played more with it i eventually decided to submit a proper fix instead. Since the rationale initially [confused reviewers](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31907#discussion_r1966033115) i tried to explain it in details in the commit message (reproduced here in OP) with enough context.\r\n\r\nThe feature_assumeutxo.py functional test contains a set of checks for expected errors when a snapshot can be parsed but contains incorrect values. Some of these checks are brittle as they assert an error that is raised not only because of the injected fault, but also because of the following data in the snapshot. A previous occurence of this was fixed in e5ff4e416ecc8a51367022eb8a7a291f8cbc0c65.\r\n\r\nIn this commit, we look into another check of the same category. This one inserts an invalid coins count for the first transaction in the snapshot. It asserts that by doing so the snapshot validation logic will try to deserialize an additional coin for the first transaction, while it fact it will be deserializing the txid of the next transaction. It then asserts that this attempt to deserialize the txid of the next transaction will result in a specific error: a coin height higher than the base height (returning the string \"Bad snapshot data after deserializing 1 coins.\").\r\n\r\nThis is an issue as it relies on data outside of the fault injected to assert the error string. For instance the next txid could well deserialize in a coin at a height lower than the base height, or (more probably) not successfully deserialize into a coin at all!\r\n\r\nFix this by injecting all the data necessary to reliably assert the expected error: an invalid coins count, followed by a valid coin, followed by a valid-serialization coin with an invalid height (which in this scenario is supposed to be the next coin's txid).",

      "message": "qa: make feature_assumeutxo.py test more robust\n\nThe feature_assumeutxo.py functional test contains a set of checks for expected errors when a\nsnapshot can be parsed but contains incorrect values. Some of these checks are brittle as they\nassert an error that is raised not only because of the injected fault, but also because of the\nfollowing data in the snapshot. A previous occurence of this was fixed in\ne5ff4e416ecc8a51367022eb8a7a291f8cbc0c65.\n\nIn this commit, we look into another check of the same category. This one inserts an invalid coins\ncount for the first transaction in the snapshot. It asserts that by doing so the snapshot validation\nlogic will try to deserialize an additional coin for the first transaction, while it fact it will be\ndeserializing the txid of the next transaction. It then asserts that this attempt to deserialize the\ntxid of the next transaction will result in a specific error: a coin height higher than the base\nheight (returning the string \"Bad snapshot data after deserializing 1 coins.\").\n\nThis is an issue as it relies on data outside of the fault injected to assert the error string. For\ninstance the next txid could well deserialize in a coin at a height lower than the base height, or\n(more probably) not successfully deserialize into a coin at all!\n\nFix this by injecting all the data necessary to reliably assert the expected error: an invalid coins\ncount, followed by a valid coin, followed by a valid-serialization coin with an invalid height\n(which in this scenario is supposed to be the next coin's txid).",

This just made the existing test deterministic, of sorts.\r\n\r\n> the old test is testing a very simple off by one error\r\n\r\nTo be honest i don't think the test as it stands today in `master` is all that useful. It claims to be testing a case where the coins count is too large. A too large coins count would \"overflow\" reading coins into the next coin's txid. In all likelihood this should fail to deserialize and return a [\"Bad snapshot format or truncated snapshot after deserializing\"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c0b7159de47592c95c6db061de682b4af4058102/src/validation.cpp#L5989-L5992) error. By some luck it happens to deserialize with the current snapshot data, so this actually tests the case where a coin has a [too high block height](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c0b7159de47592c95c6db061de682b4af4058102/src/validation.cpp#L5944-L5949). It seems the person who introduced this test just asserted the first error that arised when injecting this fault without thinking too much what this is supposed to be testing.\r\n\r\n> these tests overall have very strong assumptions about the structure of the dump (with the offset for example)\r\n\r\nIf they do then i think this should be fixed, which is what i propose in this PR. But it is not true that all those tests are similarly brittle. Let's go case by case:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c0b7159de47592c95c6db061de682b4af4058102/test/functional/feature_assumeutxo.py#L140-L155\r\n\r\n- The first one replaces the txid of the first coin with a different one. So it wouldn't break if the snapshot data changes.\r\n- The second one is the one fixed in this PR.\r\n- The third one overwrite the coins count with an insanely high value and would still run into [this error](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c0b7159de47592c95c6db061de682b4af4058102/src/validation.cpp#L5934-L5936) if the snapshot data changes.\r\n- The third one replaces the `vout` of the first coin in the first transaction with `1` instead of `0`. It would not break if the snapshot data were to change.\r\n- The fourth one does the same for the coin height+coinbase bit. Same it would not break.\r\n- The fifth one is equivalent to the fourth one.\r\n- The sixth one tests an invalid coin block height. It would still run into [this error](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c0b7159de47592c95c6db061de682b4af4058102/src/validation.cpp#L5947) if the snapshot data around it were to change.\r\n- The seventh and final one is the one that was fixed in #31907.\r\n\r\nSo besides the one that is fixed in this PR and the one that was fixed in my previous PR, none are similarly brittle.",

Given the feedback here i just went with \"update the error message and let people figure it out\" in #32155. If this PR gets renewed interest i am also happy to rebase #32155 on top of it after it's merged. Feel free also to NACK and i'll close, my feelings won't be hurt (too much :p).",

      "body": "Thanks for giving more context @darosior . I am certainly concept ACK on adding this new test and -0 on removing the old one. If other reviewers agree that the old test should be removed I'm fine with it.\r\n\r\nWe seem to have differing views on two points (that are related): 1. How much more robust the new test is than the old one, you described you view in detail now added the context for that and I just see a lot more ways that the new test could still break. 2. What level the test should focus on. I would interpret what you write as you think it's not necessary to test failures that are caught by deserialization. I guess that's fair if we assume deserialization should be covered by unit tests instead. But my view is that we shouldn't try to be too smart about these things because it can also mean something can be missed, so more of a grey/black box approach than white box.\r\n\r\nMaybe these test are not perfect but one of them [found a pretty surprising bug](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28685) so they did serve their purpose already as they are, I guess that's why I am biased to keep them around.\r\n\r\nAnother thought I had: We could, for each of these cases, mine a new chain in the test with slightly different transactions included which cover the different cases, create a new snapshot for each of them and then only swap the metadata part of these snapshots. That would guarantee that we wouldn't see any deserialization related error even if the structure (and even serialization) changes. I'm not sure that is what we should do because it would slow test down significantly nor do I think this means the new test suggested here shouldn't be added. I am just putting the thought out here to demonstrate that there is spectrum of robustness and other trade-offs here.",

For those who want to limit data carrying outputs, `-datacarriersize` is still supported, and has the functionality of applying the specified data carrier limit as well as limiting the number of data carrying OP_RETURN outputs to one. If `-datacarriersize=0` is set, no data carrying output is allowed.\r\n    \r\nRational: there's lots of ways for people to publish data in the Bitcoin chain, and lots of data has been published.  There's no reason for us to place artificial limits on this particular method.\r\n\r\nReplaces https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27261\r\n",

Large amounts of data are already published in the bitcoin blockchain in a variety of ways. Heck, `-permitbaremultisig` is still allowed by default, and people still use it to publish data in the form of spendable and even unspendable outputs. And unlike OP_Return outputs, bare multisig outputs have caused issued due to Bitcoin's broken sigop counting scheme; the OP_Return mechanism was carefully designed to avoid this problem years ago.\r\n\r\nThis proposed change simply cleans up a bit of remaining standardness paternalism; we've gotten rid of essentially all other standardness paternalism. I can't think of any standardness mechanism other than OP_Return and first-seen (which I'm arguing to remove by default in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28132)  that doesn't have a strong technical reason to exist.\r\n\r\n> > is paying me $1000 for 10 hours work to do this pull-req\r\n> \r\n> That's great, but others have to spend hours reviewing this stuff, plus occasionally having to deal with the brigading.

      "body": "> > Why do you believe that expanding a publication mechanism that is 4x more expensive than the heavily used taproot witness mechanism will \"increase the spam problems significantly\"?\r\n> \r\n> @ChristopherA just said that he's paying you to push this because it makes it cheaper and easier for him to write his non-bitcoin stuff into the chain.\r\n\r\nSome clarification: I said I would contribute $1K toward a bounty for a real PR. Others said they might contribute to that bounty as well. My real goal was to have a legitimate discussion, which is what we have been having here. It is a discussion in PRs, with working code, that is how change really happens in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nMy goal is not \"non-bitcoin stuff\". My specific challenge is that Lightning and Nostr use public keys in a persistent way that are not rotatable, which is a bad cryptographic practice. By committing to a rotated key and some other cryptographic in advance in L1, they could be.  I believe this could be as small as a signed hash and a little metadata. However, this is larger than 80-byte limit in OP_RETURN. I can now put it into an inscription-style transaction and even get a 4x discount, or use bare multisig, or use some other trick.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd prefer not to use a \"trick\", and use OP_RETURN as it is easy to identify, was explicitly created for this purpose, is not a hack, and nodes can easily ignore them. Given that the OP_RETURN limit is a relic of `is_standard`, and as @instagibbs said is \"the last remaining 'paternalism' restriction in the codebase\", and there are multiple ways to do what I'm seeking in less \"honest\" ways, so why have this legacy limit at all? Thus my reasoning to contribute to the bounty for this PR.\r\n\r\nIf @petertodd doesn't have time to continue to continue to support this PR, I'm glad to contribute toward bounties (hopefully with others) for others to keep it active.\r\n\r\n-- Christopher Allen, Blockchain Commons",

      "body": "> My goal is not \"non-bitcoin stuff\". My specific challenge is that Lightning and Nostr use public keys in a persistent way that are not rotatable, which is a bad cryptographic practice. By committing to a rotated key and some other cryptographic in advance in L1, they could be. I believe this could be as small as a signed hash and a little metadata.\r\n\r\n@ChristopherA can you clarify why is it imperative for this use case to store that data on the Bitcoin blockchain?\r\n\r\nTo give you some insight into my point of view: I'm a Bitcoin user and full node runner and my primary concern is that running a full node continues to be affordable for the rest of the 21st century, as it's necessary to maintain a global network of independent validators & copies of the blockchain. Storing non-transactional data in the blockchain makes this arbitrarily more difficult. Ceteris paribus if we encourage using the Bitcoin blockchain as a storage medium there will be much less full nodes in 2070 than otherwise. Personally I'd like to see the devs working on new standardness rules to fight the spam, not removing the existing ones.\r\n\r\nSo I hope you'll understand why I don't agree with removing `-datacarrier` nor increasing the default `-datacarriersize`, but I'm willing to live by the status quo. I'd like to ask you to try to work around the 80 byte limit if at all possible, maybe with a more compact hash and metadata encoding scheme.",

Removing the spam protection for op_return outputs effectively results in a discount for small inscriptions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you're saying yourself that you want this change because it makes it easier for you to use the chain for contentious non-bitcoin use cases such as inscribing Nostr keys. However, the reason why you currently have to use hacks to do that is simply because others just don't want to have to download and store your data to use Bitcoin. The fact that we can't prevent these kind of spam attacks is not a justification to make the problem worse. \r\n\r\nAlso I wonder why you don't use torrents to store your data? \r\n\r\n",

The key word IMV is making things cumbersom for any out of scope use of Bitcoin, not more relaxed. And enable Node operators the decision of what to support and not, by having the full nodes soware with such options, the more the better decentralized Bitcoin becomes. Core=centralized. The smaller a CORE that allows Bitcoin to run exclusively for its primary scope, the more decentralized Bitcoin becomes. The idea of CORE Devs deciding always on node operators behalf is to me obviously damaging to Bitcoin. Devs don't decide, they as service providers, provide options to the clients of Bitcoin hopefully node operators if they are able to run a tiny full node if they so wish by unsupporting all superfluous, and not an overweighted node. — Reply to this email directly, [view it on GitHub]([#28130 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28130#issuecomment-1665951546)), or [unsubscribe](https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/A3UR6LVGXEXGXWEOYKW7SCLXTUWBHANCNFSM6AAAAAA2UFSMGA).

Since the other sub-change got mired in controversy, I decided to meet my client requirement in a time-efficient manner. Obviously, I can't promise to him that this will actually get merged.

My specific challenge is that Lightning and Nostr use public keys in a persistent way that are not rotatable, which is a bad cryptographic practice. By committing to a rotated key and some other cryptographic in advance in L1, they could be. I believe this could be as small as a signed hash and a little metadata. However, this is larger than 80-byte limit in OP_RETURN. I can now put it into an inscription-style transaction and even get a 4x discount, or use bare multisig, or use some other trick.\r\n\r\nNo need to increase the limit, just build something akin to @petertodd's OpenTimestamps to store a Merkle root hash and provide the rest of the data through other channels. Use the 80 `OP_RETURN` bytes for that one SHA256 hash (32 bytes), unique service identifier (8 bytes?), maybe use the remaining (40) bytes for some kind of bloom filter data so one can rule out certain entries quickly when doing lookups?",

      "body": "> Did anyone calculate what would be the cost of placing ordinals inside a no-limit op_return output? If the costs would be higher (as I imagine) than putting them in the witness space (and taking advantage of the witness discount) then the merge of this proposal would not solve anything because people will just continue to use the cheapest way. For those reasons I'm actually in favor.. so ACK.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the financial costs one need to consider, there are other costs. Complexity of implementation and risk for long term stability are important factors as well. \r\n\r\nAdding risks to the ordinals business model by uncertainty of future support is one avenue which might be promising to counter those spam attacks. Ideas like https://twitter.com/hashtag/ordislow with delaying blocks containing ordinals might be worth considering in more detail. I don't understand why Bitcoin devs are not more engaged in those discussions. \r\n\r\nThere is no reason why one would need more than 80 bytes in OP_RETURN. I guess 40 bytes would be enough as well. If ppl want to add metadata (3rd party signatures) they have to use their own network for providing that data and use the blockchain transaction as the timestamp for securing that external data. OpenTimestamp might be enough for most such use cases. Just because its hard to run your own p2p network does not justifify to abuse the Bitcoin blockchain as database. \r\n\r\nSeems some people want to apply the fundamental mistakes of Ethereum into Bitcoin as a new attack vector.

I don't understand why Bitcoin devs are not more engaged in those discussions.\r\n\r\nBitcoin devs haven't engaged with those discussions because #ordislow is a dumb idea that is very unlikely to work; to the extent it does work, it will simply act to further centralize mining. #ordislow is fundamentally an attempt at censorship of blocks (information) we don't like. Unless a very high percentage of nodes choose to run it, it'll have no affect at all, because a moderately sized minority is sufficient to propagate blocks. And even in that circumstance, it's very easy for interested parties to run non-ordislow nodes that peer with each other to ensure good propagation of ordinal-containing blocks. This of course is easier for large miners to do, which is why #ordislow is potentially a centralizing force for Bitcoin hash power.\r\n\r\nA very similar situation is full-rbf: while only a small minority of nodes relay full-rbf replacements, in conjunction with a few dozen full-rbf peering nodes that's more than enough to reliably propagate full-rbf replacements to the ~40% of hashing power that mines them.",

This has nothing to do with KYC. Furthermore, service providers/intermediaries are welcome to use the Bitcoin network along with any other entity.  If someone who has created a data set that is stored off chain wants to sign it for attestation and produce a hash and expose both signature and hash or a url to said data without associating to their own Bitcoin for privacy reasons, or prefer paying out of band in some other asset or even god forbid fiat to an intermediary, then they should be able to.  Are you wanting to define specific constraints on a protocol within the data of an OP_RETURN, or just OP_RETURN itself? The arbitrary 80 character limit pushes towards centralization. Are you pro centralization?",

      "body": "> Rational: there's lots of ways for people to publish data in the Bitcoin chain, and lots of data has been published.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to witness data, I can easily prune all of them by downgrading my node to be a non-witness node. How to achieve the same thing for large OP_RETURNs?\r\n\r\n> There's no reason for us to place artificial limits on this particular method.\r\n\r\nThe reason is you will encourage people to downgrade the way they publish data. Witness limit is 4 MB for a reason: it is easy to prune (just disable witness), does not affect legacy nodes, and in fact makes their life easier (see what is the size of the infamous block 774628 from the perspective of a non-witness node).\r\n\r\n> Current storage methods need two txs and many deviant methods were used in the past to store things in bitcoin, as we saw recently also\r\n\r\nJust use commitments. All typical transactions contain at least one signature. If you have a single OP_CHECKSIG anywhere, you need a signature. If you use P2TR, you have a signature in your spend-by-key path, or you could use OP_CHECKSIG inside TapScript.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have a signature, it contains two parts: r-value, and s-value. You want to store something? Then just tweak your r-value in your signature, and you will get the same result as if you would when putting 256-bit hash inside OP_RETURN. With no additional on-chain bytes, and no traces that could be used to censor your transaction. For all address types that support OP_CHECKSIG or equivalent. What is the reason to not use commitments?",

Its scope is very TINY, based on principles, the decentralization trilemma (the case here) and the auditability/transparency vs privacy on-chain. When those principles are not followed or understood, you are suffering from altcoining mindset (your case, throwing confusing unrelated words like 'uncensorable speech', no different from altcoiner's 'inventions/solutions' on-chain (instead of off-chain where true ingenious innovation belongs, for Bitcoin). Bitcoin is not an altcoin because it MUST tyrannically (Satoshi's word) seek continuously more decentralization, not less as you are proposing. Bitcoin is getting more and more centralized due to all the BIP mania already introduced and reason why all current weaknesses (Segwit and Taproot are examples) exist, and it is not by adding more of such altcoining mindset weaknesses that the scenario improves, it is instead about allowing node operators more (UN)support OPTIONS in FULL (CORE) NODE SOFTWARE (not less), so that what is CORE=CENTRAL does get decided ONLY by them, and NOT by CORE DEVS who are in obvious conflict of interests as service providers in Bitcoin, NOT the true clients of Bitcoin. HASH-ANCHORING (=stamping, inscriptions,etc) in Bitcoin is possible the easier scripts are allowed by its introduced 'features', but instead Satoshi would definitely wanted it to continuously become as CUMBERSOME as possible in all ingenious ways possible with minimum scripts allowed, I am sure he would figure out eventually, to keep Bitcoin's SCOPE TYRANICALLY TINY as it was his intention (the only reason why Bitcoin has value and altcoins NOT). So, NOT make it even easier as you are proposing, throwing misplaced out-of-the-point ilogical intentionally confusing argumentation, against Bitcoin's basic principles and core value proposition.",

It's a better solution, and doesn't force others to unwillingly store your arbitrary data.\n\nBitcoin is a monetary network first, but it does also happen to be the best decentralised option we have for timestamping too. But to make use of that secondary function, you do not need to store arbitrary data on Bitcoin's blockchain, as already discussed at length above.",

      "body": "Concept ACK, this is largely how I've been using Assume().\r\n\r\nMy thinking is that due to the optimizing-out property of `Assume()`, the concern about potential performance impact is (even) lower than for `Assert()`/`assert()`, and thus one can be even more liberal when using these. Note that even `Assert()`/`assert()` tend to have very low cost for cheap conditions, as they're generally well-predicted by the CPU branch predictor (so the cost tends to be in the nanosecond or less range), but for cheap provably-side-effect-free conditions, for `Assume()` the concern just disappears entirely.\r\n\r\nSo the benefit, I think, isn't directly that `Assume()` is necessarily significantly faster than `Assert()`/`assert()` - in almost all cases in the codebase, the impact of an additional well-predicted conditional isn't going to be measurable. The benefit is that it may, for reviewers, **largely remove the consideration** of whether or not there is any performance impact at all.\r\n\r\nOf course, compared to the others it has the downside of not actually triggering in production builds, so it should be reserved for cases where (a) the code can safely continue when the assumption is violated (that's what's documented already) but also **(b) when there is sufficient test coverage** to give confidence that the assumption actually can't trigger in production.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo I think the advice about this kind of usage should be:\r\n* There aren't other reasons to have an `Assert()`/`assert()`; i.e., if it weren't for the possibility of a production-optimized-out `Assume()`, you'd instead have no assertion at all.\r\n* The condition is clearly side-effect free.\r\n* It helps readability/reviewability by making assumptions explicitly verified in fuzz tests. If the code doesn't have good fuzz test coverage, this doesn't achieve much.",

    "body": "Retains the `-datacarrier*` args, marks them as deprecated, and does not require another startup argument for multiple OP_RETURN outputs.\r\n\r\nIf a user has set `-datacarriersize` the value is \"budgeted\" across all seen OP_RETURN output scriptPubKeys. In other words the total script bytes stays the same, but can be spread across any number of outputs. This is done to not introduce an additional argument to support multiple outputs.\r\n\r\nI do not advise people use the option with custom arguments and it is marked as deprecated to not mislead as a promise to offer it forever. The argument itself can be removed in some future release to clean up the code and minimize footguns for users.",

Nodes can and do cache transactions they reject from their mempools making compact blocks just as quick to verify regardless of if some of their contents was filtered.\r\n\r\nAs for fee estimation, it does not require knowledge of \"the\" mempool and there can never be such a thing.\r\n\r\nThe efforts to design Bitcoin Core around the increased reliance on mempool homogeneity are misguided and a trend in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nMore high level - if nodes can configure their own mempool policies it obviously doesn't break things and demonstrably never has.

      "body": "Concept ACK on relaxing the maximum capacity of the `OP_RETURN` size to the current transaction standardness limit.\r\n\r\n1. This change will improve fee estimation in Bitcoin Core, as users will now be able to see the fee pressure from \"data-carier\" transactions that were previously broadcast out of band.\r\n\r\n2. It will also improve block propagation time and make mining fairer, as data carrier transactions below standardness limit will now be relayed in nodes' mempools before being included in block templates. Nodes that already have these transactions can validate new blocks faster and relay them to peers and potentially other miners. If I understand correctly, Bitcoin's incentives require miners to learn about new blocks as quickly as possible so this is a positive change.\r\n\r\n3. This could also potentially reduce the reliance on \"out-of-band\" services that collect data carrier transactions at high fees and possibly earn more revenue than other miners.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still believe that while Bitcoin Core's transaction relay policy rules have significant advantages, they leave room for out-of-band services like those in point 3. As long as new innovations seek to utilize create transactions that violate those policies, we may continue to see these services persist.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to repeat the same process of relaxing rules to address issues 1, 2, and 3.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, policy rules are an \"easy way out\" but limited solution. If we truly want to prevent issues 1, 2, and 3, those rules should be part of the consensus layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nOn Deprecating this feature: I will like to see this option not being deprecated and let's give users the ability to have a datacarier limit as they see fit; even though it is a footgun; we have a far worst option available i,e `-blocksonly` mode; in blocks only mode fee estimation is disabled.  The work in #30157 allows a node to also detect when it's mempool is roughly not in sync with miners and prevent serving fee rate estimate.",

And a few versions layers maybe the discussion to remove it altogether can be restarted. Current PR is way too sudden. It seems we did not learn the lesson from the unintentional effect lifting the witness script size limit had on the quantity of arbitrary data getting stored in the block. \r\n\r\nYes, I am aware it was possible to store data even before that, but it became economically lucrative since that specific change of removing the 10kb limit. Instead of capping that somehow, we are on a path to remove any and all data size configuration option the node runners currently have. \r\n\r\nBesides, removing this option doesn't even help in a major way to remove utxo bloat because segwit discount will still be preferred for data above a certain size threshold. \r\n\r\nEarnestly urge the project maintainers to rethink this one and implement it in more gradual changes.

It's better to err on the side of a normal deprecation path with more knobs rather than fewer, especially since this knob (`-datacarriersize`) was previously available. Its removal has been a specific point of controversy, explicitly described by some as core compelling speech. However, this conceptual change will likely affect only a small percentage of previous NACKers, since the intent and outcome seem clear and unchanged imo. At best, it provides hypothetical hope that if the option proves beneficial during the deprecation period, it might not ultimately be removed.",

Any delay in a miner receiving a compact block because nodes along the shortest (time) path for that compact block to reach them are missing transactions in that block can be entirely removed. Compact block relay doesn't need to be delayed by mempool filters. See mailing list.\r\n2. Globally consistent mempool policy is not possible, but you don't need it for transactions with larger-than-80-byte OP_RETURNS to be relayed. You just need enough nodes with more permissive relay policy. Librerelay is already an option you could be pushing people to run, and this change would allow people to achieve the same using Core without deprecating and removing options noderunners have had for years to manage their own resources. Deprecation and removal of these flags achieves absolutely nothing (besides encouraging users to run alternative implementations).\r\n3. Downloading a transaction twice is not the same as downloading it once, and uploading it N times, even where N is 1. Upload bandwidth is not download bandwidth. On many residential networks, and particularly cellular, upload bandwidth is _significantly_ lower. I can download 30x as much as I can upload in any given period. See linked comment.\r\n4. A 'new' point I've only made away from the ML and GitHub: no, missing some transactions from your mempool doesn't make all that much of a difference when setting fees. You still have a view of what's getting confirmed, and a view of all the non-filtered transactions at the top of your own mempool. As somebody who has _actually_ run a filtered mempool during periods where those filters were excluding many transactions being included within the next few blocks, it wasn't difficult to set fees.\r\nMade other points in the above linked comment, but not yet relevant to the discussion going on in this PR.",

Nodes can and do cache transactions they reject from their mempools making compact blocks just as quick to verify regardless of if some of their contents was filtered.\r\n\r\nThis is the first I have heard about this caching of non-standard transactions. If this is indeed the case, then the small-block-propagation-performance-degradation argument is largely invalidated, but this requires that the cache be sufficiently large and long-lived that the cache + mempool will effectively match a mempool without the standardness restrictions. What are the characteristics of this caching behavior, and does it actually prevent degradation of small block propagation in practice?",

I'm not sure I'd even rate those as a nit, though.\r\n\r\nI don't see any issue with allowing multiple op-returns -- only using one where possible is already encouraged via it being cheaper in fees, and there's otherwise no significant impact on nodes that I can see.\r\n\r\nI don't think this PR will have any impact on fee estimation (the only way that would occur is if a large majority of the mempool were transactions with multiple OP_RETURN outputs or an OP_RETURN output larger than 83 bytes, and that's not the case).\r\n\r\nI think the impact of this PR on block relay is likely to also be very small; probably slightly negative in the short term, as more blocks are mined with txs with more/larger OP_RETURNs before many nodes in the network include such txs in their mempool, and slightly positive in the long term, as more nodes in the network do include those txs in their mempools.\r\n\r\nBased on citrea's Clementine design, I think this will slightly lower how much the utxo set gets spammed -- trying to get every bit of data published on the blockchain moved to the witness or reduced to a commitment still seems possible to me, but given the complexity of BitVM-style protocols and bridges in general, I suspect it's unlikely that developers of those protocols will be willing to spend much time shaving off bytes here and there like we might otherwise like. Given that, it seems better to make the easiest solution one that also minimises long term harm, and leave the incentive for shaving off bytes to just be minimising fees.",

Private markets offering these services reflect a willingness to pay for non-standard transactions, and this market demand does not justify altering Bitcoin’s core design to subsidize these use cases.\r\n\r\nThese two statements are incongruent with each other, as out-of-band services directly undermine the decentralization and accessibility of the network by eroding the transparency of the fee market as well as miner rewards.",

This makes the most sense since proponents of both sides of this argument say they don't want arbitrary data in the blockchain and that mempool policy should be tightly coupled with consensus policy.

The witness data bloat was the focus of a PR from several years ago by luke-jr that added additional data-carrier filters, not this or the related PR by petertodd. The origin of this is an L2/sidechain use case that requires 144 bytes of ZKP data in transaction outputs -- they cannot rely upon stuffing it into witness data because so many nodes already filter out such transactions. The argument is that the current OP_RETURN filter incentivizes more harmful UTXO bloat compared to larger OP_RETURN outputs which can be dropped from the UTXO set.\r\n\r\nI find that argument somewhat persuasive; however, after reading more arguments and giving it a bit more thought, concept NACK for deprecating the option instead of just changing the default configuration to fit the specific use case that started this whole controversy. From a UX design perspective, software should have sane defaults but not prevent power users from tuning, experimenting, and/or breaking their own systems.",

It is not different enough to just removing the feature entirely today, thus is isn't a compromise. Some are saying that features can stay deprecated for years but that's a false equivalence because those features are not as controversial as the OP_RETURN limit.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the default OP_RETURN limit to 100,000 is also contentious and should not be merged without further discussion on the mailing list. Forcing node runners to do extra setup work to limit data carrier transactions is against the preference of a significant group of node runners. Increasing the default limit still incentivizes them to migrate to alternative node implementations that don't require extra setup steps. Keeping the default OP_RETURN limit at 80 bytes or a somewhat sensible 144 bytes is a better compromise. Data usage above 144 bytes is less expensive in witness data anyway because of the discount so no reason to raise the default limit above 144 bytes.",

      "body": "utACK  while I'm doubtful my comment should carry much weight, I'm wary of the public presentation weight up vacuous opposition, which ought count for nothing, against an absence of positive comments (because the choice is obvious enough that little need be said)... and the most effective thing I can do on that point is to get counted.\r\n\r\nI have a slight preference for the closed PR that removes it completely. This is primarily because removing it completely avoids some predictable meta-abuse (e.g. the same people who deceived others about this PR existing, claiming they narrowly saved the day when no great doom happens). Also I have some small concern that if/when the contributors decide total removal would be best that they'll refrain from doing so out of a justified fear of another public abuse campaign, which could be avoided by just doing it now.   That said, since these aren't points that go to the substance of the change itself, the other PR is currently closed, I don't think they matter much and I wouldn't fault someone for saying such reasoning should be completely disregarded.  I'll refrain for further meta-points, though I think they are worth at least some consideration because they are akin to technical debt created by the proposal (but they are political rather than technical). As far as actually when the settings are removed after this PR, if ever, I think that is mostly just the judgement of the maintainers in terms of combinatorics testing cost and codebase cleanliness.\r\n\r\nI am November Alpha Charlie Kilo (drat bot!) on suggestions that leave the limit slightly increased for some user or another (as mentioned by @ariel-lore  @ajtowns and the later @k98kurz comment) unless they come with a credible argument that ~all the hashpower will enforce the same limit.  Without that, a increased limit but still less than what many miners will do leaves the harmful gap between relay and mining policy.  I think it would be an obviously poor choice that undermines much of the principled argument for making the change at all. (and to be clear, I would agree that *all* substantive discrepancies ought to be closed either by convincing miners to change behavior or removing the restrictions, and if a discrepant rule is hiding a DOS vulnerability it must be fixed either in code or consensus rules).  If there were a serious argument that progress could be made getting most hashpower to enforce some other limit, then I would agree with trying to achieve that.  My understanding however is that there is no real prospect of that. \r\n\r\nTurning to the substance above,  @k98kurz advances an argument that rejected transactions are cached as a reason relay/mining mismatches don't hurt block propagation.  @instagibbs provides a technically correct response that the caching is insignificant and demonstratively doesn't avoid the problem, but I think it's important to give a broader answer in the context of this PR and the default relay policy of Bitcoin Core:  If the transaction is never relayed to you because all your peers dropped it then no amount of caching can help.\r\n\r\nCaching, when it is successful, reduces the bandwidth inflation from transmitting the txn twice (once to just throw it out, the second when it shows up in a block) and it may diminish the block relay harm caused by a small number of mining-inconsistent nodes.  Improving that caching might help a little but especially in terms of widely deployed policy it can't help much because nodes simply won't see the transactions.  Steel-manning the opposition a little: It could be argued that block relay could be improved to be less sensitive to missed transactions.  I agree that it could and should, but doing so is very technically complex, unlikely to be accomplished safely in the social climate exhibited in these PRs, and that even at it's best is inherently inferior to already having the transaction and having already validated it.  The best improvements we know of also trade more bandwidth usage to diminish the huge round trip delays, so keeping the discrepancy as small as can be is important to them.  Some rare discrepancy is unavoidable, but filtering transactions that *will* get mined is an entirely unforced error.\r\n\r\n[And as co-designer of the block relay mechanism: the extras pool is intended to deal with replacement races-- when a new replacement comes in for a little while it's anyone's guess which one a just found block will have. Depending on the ordering the miner saw the transactions a block could have any version, even when replacement would be denied by the replacement rules. Most of the time in the Bitcoin p2p network we took an assumption that relay and mining policy would not have any persistent substantive differences.] \r\n\r\nThe comment of @BootsStribling appears to be disconnected from reality in a manner characteristic of LLM hallucinations.  It takes a number of positions which would be interesting if they were true or substantiated in any way by the comment.  I don't think there is any serious dispute that this PR will not make the default behavior more consistent with what gets mined.\r\n\r\nAs far as fee estimation goes, the actual estimator is designed to be robust against missed transactions (they're basically ignored)--  but I know that I and many other people I know look at an actual mempool to make decisions on what to bid against... and having transactions unknown to us that will likely show up in the next block makes it harder to make a good decision.  Again, I don't think there is any serious dispute on this point.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other easily addressed fallacious points I've seen raised in opposition to this elsewhere, but since they haven't (yet) been raised here I won't (yet) readdress them,  I don't think they're useful even as steelmanning the opposition because none of my counters on those have been countered.  If anyone has any interest they can go follow my recent reddit traffic (u/nullc) which has been ~exclusively on this subject.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n[And if anyone wants to respond to me but can't do so here for whatever reason, please reach out directly... my email is available to anyone!]\r\n\r\n",

I've left a few nits, but nothing blocking, especially in a PR with this much activity.\r\n\r\nWith the new default, I think users disabling or lowering `datacarriersize` are mostly reducing the performance of their own node, so I am in support of removing it completely. However, some people seem really keen on continuing to be able to do so, so pragmatically I think the approach taken in this PR is sensible. Changing the default is what's really important here.",

Knots is trying to filter what it defines as spam and Core[ isn't](https://btctranscripts.com/adopting-bitcoin/2021/2021-11-16-gloria-zhao-transaction-relay-policy). I don't know if it makes sense for Core to try catering to Knots' objectives when they clash with Core's objectives. It makes more sense for Core to direct users who want to attempt to filter spam-like transactions to run Knots instead.\r\n\r\nThat might be anathema to some but mempool policy isn't consensus critical and consensus compatible forks like Knots are there for those who strongly disagree with the merge decisions or the direction of travel of Core on non-consensus changes. I don't think anyone needs or wants this kind of discussion every time Core makes a change to mempool policy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my two cents for what it is worth.\r\n",

Expressed use cases can be accommodated in a simpler way with a minor size change.

Arguments for block propagation speed and fee estimates, though technically sound, are potentially minor compared to forcing the default size to max.  Slow this down and move towards this goal if this is what you ultimately think is best, but gradually, allowing node runners to respond instead of being forced. \r\n\r\nDefinitely do not deprecate",

Obviously, it is off-topic to discuss here, but I think there is a misunderstanding what the goal of the summary comment by the bot is. The goal is *not* to have everyone \"register\" their \"vote\". It is simply a best-effort overview to have a clickable link to every reviewer's most recent review comment. The technical content of those review comments is what matters, not how many are registered in what category. This is also explained in the comment above the table: \"See [the guideline](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-review) for information on the review process.\"\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

      "body": "ACK 35bcd8eed38130445aef5ebe217ab42248fa6f18 -- only minor tweaks since previous review\r\n\r\n[I wrote](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#pullrequestreview-2832143503):\r\n\r\n> I don't think this PR will have any impact on fee estimation (the only way that would occur is if a large majority of the mempool were transactions with multiple OP_RETURN outputs or an OP_RETURN output larger than 83 bytes, and that's not the case).\r\n\r\n[gmaxwell wrote](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406#issuecomment-2874791860):\r\n\r\n> As far as fee estimation goes, the actual estimator is designed to be robust against missed transactions (they're basically ignored)-- but I know that I and many other people I know look at an actual mempool to make decisions on what to bid against... and having transactions unknown to us that will likely show up in the next block makes it harder to make a good decision.\r\n\r\nPrior to this discussion, there were only 61 txs included in blocks in the prior ~11 months (blocks 846,000 to 894,000) that this PR would allow to be relayed (using up ~0.004% of blockspace during that period). Since this discussion started, that's increased, eg to ~0.16% with ~11,800 txs (in blocks 894,000 to 896,528), though that rises to 3.1% of blockspace if you only count the blocks that actually included such txs. Those levels seem pretty easy to cope with, no matter how you calculate fees. (Only 3 of the 61 txs had multiple OP_RETURNs, 33 had a single OP_RETURN scriptPubKey between 84 and 160 bytes, and there were an additional six OP_RETURNs in txs larger than 100kvB which will still be non-standard if this PR is merged, one of which was also 0 fees)\r\n\r\ngmaxwell also wrote:\r\n\r\n> I would agree that _all_ substantive discrepancies ought to be closed either by convincing miners to change behavior or removing the restrictions,\r\n\r\nI don't disagree with this in principle, but I don't think the level of non-standard OP_RETURNs that we were seeing prior to this topic being raised for discussion (ie 61 txs over a period of 48,000 blocks) should be counted as a \"substantive\" discrepency.\r\n\r\nIf it were to be counted, I think that's a goal that's pretty unlikely to be achievable -- eg [Mara's slipstream](https://slipstream.mara.com/) has a transaction privacy policy (\"Before they are mined, yes. Your transactions are not broadcasted to the Bitcoin network until they have received at least one confirmation\") which is advertised as being particularly useful to prevent token mints being sniped. Violations of other standardness rules (particularly tx size/weight) or using replace-by-feerate policies versus replace-by-fee ones also seem likely to remain sources of occasional discrepencies.",

However, I have not encountered any strong technical or incentive compatible argument in favor of keeping it. Deprecating and giving a little bit more opportunity for such an argument to appear before removal seems like a diplomatically acceptable solution.\r\n\r\nI don't feel strongly enough about this to have kicked this hornets nest of a debate in the first place. However, we hopefully already paid most of the cost for this debate in energy and trust in the short term, so getting closer to removal should free up energy in the long term.\r\n\r\nSpammers can use networks like Libre Relay with preferential peering to circumvent this limit anyway.\r\n\r\nRelaying OP_RETURNs between ~80-~140 bytes does not substantially change the economics for spammers using witness data today.\r\n\r\nGist for more in-depth arguments with attempt to steel-man opposition: https://gist.github.com/hodlinator/501ed81c61b06b6e082663ca646655eb\r\n\r\n### Approach\r\n\r\nThorough.

      "body": "@pinheadmz a \"technically\" accurate gotcha attempt that ignores the deeper issue. The adoption drop signals a real erosion of trust, not just a casual exercise of open-source freedom. When a change pushes away a substantial portion of the user base, dismissing it as \"just fork it\" ignores a practical reality. Open-source principles are a little more evolved than \"the code is public\" and require transparent decision-making that respects diverse input. When \"reasonable\" is defined by the few and dissenters are told to fork off, it stifles meaningful community participation. I like to think most contributors in this repo agree on this fundamental principle.",

      "body": "Concept NACK. I have to disagree with the the concept of removing user control over mempool policies and the potential for massive increases in blockchain bloat. The 83-byte limit isn't arbitrary - it's there to prevent people from turning Bitcoin into a data storage service. We need to think of the possible worst case scenarios of this change, e.g. data hoarders filling up blocks with data, pushing out actual Bitcoin payments. The fee market gets completely screwed up when you mix payment transactions with data storage. Someone storing a file can wait days. But someone trying to buy something on-chain needs that transaction to go through now. \r\nHere's the thing that really gets me: we're removing the user's choice about this stuff. Right now, if you want to run a node that doesn't relay huge data blobs, you can do that. This change forces everyone to participate in the data storage business whether they want to or not. That's the opposite of what Bitcoin is supposed to be about. If we actually cared about fixing fee estimation or block propagation, we'd improve the algorithms that handle those things. Instead, we're ripping out protections that have worked fine for years and hoping it somehow makes things better. That's not engineering - that's wishful thinking.",

However i am fine with any approach (including this one) which gets rid of the poor incentive unnecessarily set by the existing limit.\r\n\r\nSince this change has created a significant amount of confusion among bitcoiners, i have compiled a list of objections and concerns raised by the community and addressed them all [in a single post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/addressing-community-concerns-and-objections-regarding-my-recent-proposal-to-relax-bitcoin-cores-standardness-limits-on-op-return-outputs/1697). This post notably contains all objections that were raised on the original PR (#32359). I won't reproduce the whole content here but here is a list of the objections addressed in the post:\r\n- \"Schrödinger filters: there is a double standard whereby 'Core' is claiming that filters don’t work but actually they do because we need to change the OP_RETURN limit.\"\r\n- \"Nirvana argument: this change is being pushed by people who believe the lack of a perfect solution to fight arbitrary data storage onchain means we should give up fighting it altogether.\"\r\n- \"OP_RETURN was only ever made standard at all as a tolerated form of data carrying to prevent more harmful forms of data carrying (fake pubkeys/script hashes/bare multisig/etc). To serve that purpose, it only needs to be ~40 bytes. The ~80 byte allowance is beyond sufficient for its intended purpose.\"\r\n- \"The proper response to a spam attack is not to cave to the spammers.\"\r\n- \"People won’t move from using fake pubkeys to op_return to be nice to us is ludicrous because it’d cost them 4x more. This is just bluff to kill the filters.\"\r\n- \"Removing all limits on OP_RETURNs creates a perverse incentive: transactions can now carry large, non-economic payloads while avoiding long-term storage costs.\"\r\n- \"A given quantity of data stored in a op_return output has a far larger negative externality on the throughput than the same data stored in a witness.\"\r\n- \"Boiling frog: Core developers are trying to gradually make Bitcoin a universal database instead of just money, one step at a time.\"\r\n- \"Core is trying to accommodate the Taproot Wizards who are a self-declared attack on Bitcoin which tries to corrupt the ecosystem.\"\r\n- \"Core contributors actually believe that Bitcoin should be used for anything rather than just money. They should argue that instead of rationalizing with dishonest arguments such as UTxO bloat which is not the real reason they are pushing it.\"\r\n- \"Antoine Poinsot paid Peter Todd to open the pull request to Bitcoin Core.\"\r\n- \"Taking a step back from the technical details, Core is trying to push a contentious change that obviously everybody is annoyed with.\"\r\n- \"As the reference implementation, Core has a responsibility of steering away from controversy as much as possible. It is irresponsible for Core to merge this change because of the number of people objecting to it on the Github pull request.\"\r\n- \"The way this is being rushed is a red flag.\"\r\n- \"This is making changes for the sake of making changes when nobody asked for this.\"\r\n- \"This proposal won’t allow to reach the stated goal (limiting the misuse of witness data).\"\r\n- \"Introducing filters is what Satoshi did, this is a departure from his legacy.\"\r\n- \"This type of change should be treated with no less scrutiny than a hard fork, because that’s essentially what this is\"\r\n- \"That may sound like hyperbole, but it really isn’t. If this PR is merged, Bitcoin as we know it changes forever in the most fundamental way imaginable: the reference implementation explicitly turning the Bitcoin network into an arbitrary data storage system, instead of evolving it as a decentralized currency.\"\r\n- \"While provably unspendable outputs are preferable to dust outputs in some contexts, the absence of any guardrails could make it easier for bad actors to stress the network, especially in combination with existing vulnerabilities.\"\r\n- \"Data stored in an OP_RETURN output doesn’t need to be chunked like it does in an inscription. This presents a risk for node runners as it allows anyone to store unobfuscated data on their disk.\"\r\n- \"Considering the floodgates of absolutely horror this PR is going to bring upon Bitcoin node runners, there absolutely needs to be a way for existing users to protect themselves and retroactively apply this on-disk obfuscation to existing node data.\"\r\n- \"This PR lowers the bar for storing large contiguous chunks arbitrary data on the systems of thousands of node runners worldwide from “you must get a miner to mine this for you” down to “you have to broadcast it and pay a fee”.\"\r\n- \"I think the bar to bypass IsStandard is very underestimated. The fact that we don’t see huge OP_RETURNs all the time proves its overall effectiveness in protecting the network as a first line of defense.\"\r\n- \"The -datacarrier option should be kept on Bitcoin Core regardless of whether the default is changed.\"\r\n- \"As a node runner I should be allowed to configure my mempool and not have it filled with what I consider spam. This can make running a node very RAM expensive.\"\r\n- \"This PR is completely pointless from a technical and incentives perspective unless combined with something like #28408 to make OP_RETURN the “proper” way to store data.\"\r\n- \"I am also concerned that in the future we might see a large scale bypassing of the Core standarness rules, but it’s unclear whether we’ve reached that point yet. We can always reconsider dropping the OP_RETURN limit once it becomes truly problematic - but, and this is a genuine question, are we there yet?\"\r\n- \"Raising UTxO bloat as a concern is beyond ironic when considering applications like Citrea may only cause trivial amount of bloat while inscriptions, which Core refuses to filter, are responsible for over 8 GiB of bloat in the past couple of years.\"\r\n- \"Bitcoin Core dev should rather focus on Bitcoin as money.\"\r\n- \"Bitcoin Core lifting the OP_RETURN limit is sending a signal that data storage is welcome, whereas before it was only tolerated.\"\r\n- \"Increasing the size of OP_RETURN is an existential threat to Bitcoin.\"\r\n- \"If you don’t upgrade Core devs are going to accuse you of censorship.\"\r\n\r\nThen there were multiple objections and concerns raised around inscriptions and large amounts of onchain data storage, which lifting the `OP_RETURN` standardness limit has no bearing on. Here is the list of objections i addressed in this post, in a collapsible section as it is tangential but off-topic for this thread.\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Click to see list of objections to not filtering inscriptions / JPEGs</summary>\r\n\r\n- \"Bitcoin always had filters. Not reacting to inscriptions is departing from 15 years of precedent.\"\r\n- \"Relay filters have historically been successful at preventing 'spam'.\"\r\n- \"Raising UTxO bloat as a concern is ironic when considering applications like Citrea may only cause trivial amount of bloat while inscriptions, which Core refuses to filter, are responsible for over 8 GiB of bloat in the past couple of years.\" (inscription version)\r\n- \"See, inscription respect the dust limit therefore filters are working!\"\r\n- \"Filtering will reduce supply and therefore suppress demand for inscriptions by increasing the cost of using them.\"\r\n- \"Bitcoin should not try to optimize for more things than being money. Anything else is diluting focus.\"\r\n- \"We should not be bidding for block space against non-monetary usecases.\"\r\n- \"This is the first step toward preventing arbitrary data storage at the consensus level. The threat of making it consensus invalid may be enough to deter usage entirely.\"\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nOne new objection i can see in the thread here that is not covered in my Delving post is one raised by @moth-oss and then @earonesty here that we should favour bumping the default  limit instead of doing with it entirely. I offered [a steelman of this argument](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/7Q6uglccxrI_LPvP2bKeTwFcBAKJ5u8u6NHtDl-dNev_kplv2lfh46r-z2iflmtnnsa8YWgn1A2M8S0jLORI2GxwNQ7qmfyM2jqQiB6JTiw=@protonmail.com/) on the mailing list and Greg Maxwell offered [a rebuttal](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CAAS2fgRyu1HKHDk_aCyHXqe+sgYpcApjmXx3Ps4ChpBAxeBcpw@mail.gmail.com/). TL;DR: the cat is already out of the bag, miners already include arbitrarily large OP_RETURN outputs in their block templates, therefore Bitcoin Core should do it (and relay such transactions) by default. In addition i think there is a social aspect to this: this limit is unnecessary and only exists for historical reasons. We should just get rid of it and doing it in multiple steps just leaves more opportunities for people creating confusion among bitcoiners on this topic to weaponize it again.",

Obviously we are _hoping_ for an increase in the number of >80 byte OP_Returns, as projects switch to OP_Return instead of undependable UTXOs. Publishing data in general is already done on a large scale in witnesses, at 1/4th the cost of OP_Return.\r\n> […](#)\r\n> On June 7, 2025 1:00:38 AM GMT+02:00, BitcoinMechanic ***@***.***> wrote: BitcoinMechanic left a comment ([bitcoin/bitcoin#32406](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32406)) Hi @darosier nowhere in your comprehensive rebuttal do you mention that **>99% of OP RETURNs in the chain fit within the limit imposed by the existing filter** That is **despite the fact that people are deliberately trying to demonstrate how \"useless\" filters are by going out of band to get miners to manually add this stuff to their block templates**. It's very simple: before you merge this PR, most OP RETURNs will be limited to 80 bytes or less. If it gets merged, there will be a massive increase in OP RETURNs larger than that. Magically everyone in Bitcoin Core has managed to get cause and effect the wrong way around.\r\n\r\nYes, I'm well aware of the rationalization here. \r\n\r\nAs long as it continues to ignore the implication - that if a filter is annoying enough to prevent > 80 byte ORs then it can be just as annoying to witness abuse too - then you don't have a serious discussion about mitigation of harmful effects of non-monetary use of Bitcoin. Rather, it's a farce in which \"discussion\" is just cherry picking in service of an agenda to facilitate more of it.",

Nevertheless, I'd like to put down some thoughts.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it's good UX for Bitcoin Core to perform the best fee estimation, which means relaying the most relevant transactions to that estimation.\r\n\r\nSounds like this PR looks to do that by configuring Bitcoin Core to relay large \"data carrier\" transactions, which are currently actually being mined but getting relayed using out-of-band software.  This seems like a good idea to me, since it brings a Core instance's view of the pending transactions closer to the true set that exist.\r\n\r\nThese \"data carrier\" transactions are not relevant to Bitcoin's use as a currency, and with respect to Bitcoin's use as a currency, are spam.  However, the protocol allows them and so they must be taken into account.  If the validity of these non-financial transactions is considered a bug, then IMO fixing that bug is a separate issue from providing the best fee estimation.\r\n\r\nI would add, transaction fees are not the only incentive that miners have.  If mining \"spam\" lowers Bitcoin's value, then miners are incentivized to mine other transactions.  I think they're incentivized to mine the transactions that give them the most spendable value, not strictly those that give them the most Bitcoin.\r\n\r\ntldr; ACK",

But you don't want to give up even one inch, because your real goal is to add \"filters\" to Bitcoin Core that will block many more transaction types with real economic demand.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core has clearly decided not to go down that path: https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/06/06/relay-statement/\r\n\r\nAll I can suggest is that Knots is welcome to try something different. But we both know that Knots isn't going to be effective at preventing transactions from being mined even if it gets, say, 50% of nodes and 25% of hash power. You need Bitcoin Core on board to have any chance of success; Bitcoin Core doesn't want to further centralize mining by wrecking the profitability of the P2P transaction relay network.\r\n\r\nOn June 7, 2025 8:57:00 PM GMT+02:00, BitcoinMechanic ***@***.***> wrote:\r\n>BitcoinMechanic left a comment (bitcoin/bitcoin#32406)\r\n>\r\n>> BitcoinMdchanic: As we have repeatedly made clear, the reason why we want to remove the OP_Return limits is because they're sufficiently annoying that projects like Citrea are publishing data in the UTXO set instead. Obviously we are _hoping_ for an increase in the number of >80 byte OP_Returns, as projects switch to OP_Return instead of undependable UTXOs.

It's very simple: before you merge this PR, most OP RETURNs will be limited to 80 bytes or less. If it gets merged, there will be a massive increase in OP RETURNs larger than that.

Relaying OP RETURNs 1000x the size we do now is the latter.

If you care about UTXO bloat, you filter inscriptions, you don't blow up datacarriersize in the hopes that a few BitVM fail-cases use OP RETURN instead of fake pub keys resulting in a few kb a year more bloat than the 8GB that have been added due to inscriptions.\r\n\r\n>this pull-req is not a significant change\r\n\r\nThen why not close the PR as controversial as per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28408 ?\r\n\r\nAll that's being done by ramming this through is making it impossible to deny some hidden agenda.\r\n\r\n>Knots\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice.

And certainly not spam in any traditional sense as the parties to the transaction are eagerly consenting. \r\n\r\nThis seems to always be the trajectory of censors in traditional system were access could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing principle against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. \r\n\r\nWho knows if any of it is *good* (... after all, most ideas are trash. :P), but one of the major reasons for Bitcoin existing is that no one gets to pass that kind of judgement.  If Bitcoin itself needed someone's permission to exist it never would have.  Bitcoin takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread and hard to stifle.\r\n\r\nCensors protest \"it's not censorship to block spam\".  It's an appealing argument on the surface, but only until you realize that the next step is to just define everything they don't like or don't understand as \"spam\" or whatever other quality that they've rationalized blocking (in one recent discussion on this subject my counterpart instantly lost the debate by accusing me of being in favor of child-abuse photos! think of the children: block transactions!).  That inevitability is why Bitcoin was designed to take away, or at least radically diminish, that judgement in the first place.   And that's not even going into the shortsightedness of making yourself responsible for the conduct of others.\r\n\r\nWhen John Gilmore wrote \"The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it\", it was more aspirational than true.

It's not likely to see significant usage, but if it did it would the usage would either move fake outputs to opreturn thus improving UTXO set effects or it would be displacing other usage which would make blocks smaller, because OP_RETURN is 100% non-witness data it counts for more weight than typical transactions.\r\n\r\nIt's like how if you have a bag which is normally filled with mostly rubber ducks and limited to 4 kg and you add some ball bearings while keeping the same weight constraint the bag with some ball bearings will have lower volume than a bag with smaller amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n> The opposite is just as likely. The levels of data being stored in other ways could remain the same while completely new uses for a bigger op return emerge.\r\n\r\nThe block weight is limited, so op_return (being denser than typical transactions) will reduce block sizes or have no effect.\r\n\r\n> This is a major flaw in the reasoning in support of this pr.\r\n\r\nNo one here, my self included has advanced this as a reasons for the PR.  I was responding to someone complaining of IBD bottlenecks and pointed out that the actual use of op_return itself won't make IBD worse-- since its the easiest thing that can go in blocks IBD wise it could even make it better by displacing other things that are IBD-worse.  It's not a reason for this PR because it's unlikely for the usage to be significant enough to matter.  (Also making IBD faster at the expense of fewer transactions is mostly the position advanced by Luke-jr who wants to reduce blocks to 300kb *still* and certainly not myself)\r\n",

      "body": "After weighing the technical arguments for/against this change and considering the objections [0], I believe this is ready for merge. Below is my handwritten summary outlining why I think so. I’m including (non-exhaustive list of) links where possible, so if you’d like to analyze the same sources without my personal bias, please do.\r\n\r\nThe concept was discussed here, #32359, #28130, #32381, the mailing list / google group [1], delving [2][3][4], stacker news [5], twitter, etc.\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this PR is to correct a mismatch between the harmfulness and standardness of data storage techniques. It makes the (prunable) OP_RETURN option available so that data is not stuffed into unprunable outputs. While proponents of the PR aren’t enthusiastic about data storage as a use case, the existing standard methods (e.g. bare pubkeys) involve bloating the UTXO set, representing a long term cost to the network. This concern is not merely theoretical, as there are examples of designs and transactions that utilize the more harmful techniques [1].\r\n\r\nAnother motivation is to support Bitcoin’s public, decentralized market for blockspace, by not making transaction relay policy stricter than what is reliably mined [14]. The OP_RETURN limits are among very few policy rules that exist solely to discourage use. These restrictions push people - e.g. ones who don’t want to bloat the UTXO set - towards direct-to-miner submission, which harms mempool utility and creates centralization pressure. This is consistent with the rationale to change the default value of `-mempoolfullrbf` to 1.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate, the PR helps avoid a world in which an economically relevant volume of transactions is sent using direct submission. We move closer to that world when large economic actors (L2s, exchanges, etc.) choose to build direct relationships with large miners in order to get nonstandard transactions mined. If widely used, central submission services undermine the permissionless design of PoW-based consensus, hurt the censorship resistance and privacy of transaction broadcast, and destroy the fast block propagation our network has enjoyed for many years… all while not preventing the nonstandard transactions we dislike. Such services exist and are in use today; it is worth trying to reduce reasons to use them. [6][7]\r\n\r\nThese are strong motivations to change the default. I also believe all of the objections have been adequately addressed [0]. Summarized below:\r\n\r\n(1) Some users want options to control what kinds of data-carrying transactions they allow on their nodes.\r\n\r\nThis PR, replacing #32359, doesn’t remove the `-datacarrier` or `-datacarriersize` options. Contrary to what many are saying, the PR does not force the user to accept larger datacarrier transactions in transaction relay. Setting `-datacarrier=0` still turns it off, and `-datacarriersize=83` gives you the original default (the same amount of data but across 1 or more outputs).\r\n\r\nSome developers still believe the option should be removed, but there is consensus for waiting at least 1 release like we did for `-mempoolfullrbf`. No timeline is set for removal.\r\n\r\nThe options are deprecated in this PR, meaning they remain usable without any extra steps, but are discouraged through a warning message. This discouragement comes from the development philosophy that all user options should either come with clear recommendations for how to use them or, if no recommendation can be made, they should not exist or be discouraged. In essence, “don’t offer users footguns”. It seems that not all frequent contributors agree with this philosophy, but I think the conversation can be deferred until there is a proposal for removal of the option.\r\n\r\n(2) Disapproval of the “arbitrary data storage use case” on the Bitcoin network (there are many many tweets that I am not linking here, but yes I did see them) [11][12][13]\r\n\r\n(2a) Belief that Bitcoin Core default policy should be used to prevent certain kinds of use cases.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for Bitcoin Core to prevent certain kinds of transactions from being mined. It is software run only voluntarily by users (which may include miners). Demanding that Bitcoin Core prevent certain transactions from being mined reflects a misunderstanding of the relationship between open source software users and developers.\r\n\r\nIn earlier years, mempool policy helped shape wallet behavior *proactively* when miner and user software was more homogeneous. Once transactions are regularly mined, restrictive policy has the effect of blinding nodes to transactions that are later included in blocks. This rationale was used to change the default of `-mempoolfullrbf` in #30493.\r\n\r\n(2b) Even if Bitcoin Core cannot prevent certain use cases, it should still not relay transactions that are not in service of its monetary purpose to discourage them.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is nontrivial harm in blinding a node to transactions that are likely to be mined, as described above.\r\n\r\nOther Bitcoin clients consider filtering non-monetary uses of Bitcoin in transaction relay as one of their development priorities, which is their prerogative. Some people have also opened pull requests to “fix the filters” within Bitcoin Core (e.g. #28408, #29520, #29187).\r\n\r\nThe reactions to these pull requests *did* show that, in general, using mempool policy to “filter” transactions is controversial amongst contributors.\r\n\r\nBriefly summarized: these kinds of policy rules are impossible to implement comprehensively, are not appropriate for protocol-level code, and cannot compete with economic demand. The “spam” applications operate on hype cycles and can change storage methods instantly; policy changes take at least 6 months to be deployed and even longer to be widely adopted (if they are at all). Ultimately, people who work on Bitcoin to enable censorship resistant payments likely don’t want to work on code that judges transactions based on their use case.\r\n\r\nWhile Bitcoin Core aims to have no central authority directing it, the project’s direction is decided by its contributors, and the vast majority of them don’t seem to hold this priority. [14].\r\n\r\nSimilarly, another Bitcoin client could focus on hyper-optimizing for performance on specific hardware and drop support for others; Bitcoin Core’s contributors might not pursue that due to their priority of making node running highly accessible. Another project might prioritize rapid response to security vulnerabilities and build in auto-updates; Bitcoin Core’s contributors would likely reject this kind of developer-user relationship. (There aren’t collective statements about these beliefs, I’m just giving examples that I personally think are plausible).\r\n\r\n(2c) Concerns that this encourages more arbitrary data storage, either because it is made cheaper, standardness represents what is “kosher,” or there is an ulterior motive to purposefully enable it. “The filters work, so don’t remove them.”\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is not to encourage people to flood blocks with OP_RETURNs, just as changing the default of `-mempoolfullrbf` to 1 was not a signal that people should try to cheat zeroconf merchants. The commentary across all platforms is overwhelmingly in favor of Bitcoin’s monetary use case, even amongst those who think that arbitrary data storage is useful. Software users should look for projects whose developers demonstrate commitment to the monetary use case through their work, not through social media virtue signaling.\r\n\r\nThe on-chain cost has not changed. OP_RETURNs are more expensive than non-Bitcoin perpetual storage methods. Within Bitcoin, OP_RETURNs cost proportionally more than typical payments that benefit from the witness discount. While it is true that the (small) additional cost of using private mempool services may be saved, as summarized above, it is important that miners don’t make significant extra money from mining these transactions.\r\n\r\n(3) Belief that large OP_RETURNs are spam, harmful, abusive, or dangerous to the network and should be discouraged in transaction relay on those grounds [15].\r\n\r\nThere are categories of transactions that policies should discourage: upgradeable fields, security and DoS problems, and transactions that make it too difficult to assess incentive compatibility [16][17]. OP_RETURN isn’t expensive to validate, doesn’t impact incentive compatibility assessment, has no potential for UTXO set pollution, etc. which is why it does not meet these criteria. Instead, people seem to use the term “spam” as an inaccurate name for undesirable transactions [18].\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the limits was indeed intended to protect network resources at a time when these outputs were not prunable, blocks were mostly empty, and 1sat/vB was almost free [19]. Contrast that with today’s environment, where prunable outputs represent a relatively low cost to the network and there exists a substantial economic deterrent to filling blocks with OP_RETURNs.\r\n\r\nOne significant cost to Bitcoin is reputational (many of us dislike the association with popular uses of OP_RETURN). But this is far outweighed by other goals like compact block reconstruction and mempool utility.\r\n\r\n(4) Consideration for the approach of only raising the limit slightly, for example to the threshold at which OP_RETURN becomes more expensive than inscriptions [20][21].\r\n\r\nGoing back to the primary principle of not restricting policy further than what miners are confirming (unless there is another reason like DoS), a small increase would not achieve this PR’s intended purpose [22].\r\n\r\n[0] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7282#page-7 \r\n[1] https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/d6ZO7gXGYbQ/m/mJyek28lDAAJ\r\n[2] https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/addressing-community-concerns-and-objections-regarding-my-recent-proposal-to-relax-bitcoin-cores-standardness-limits-on-op-return-outputs/1697\r\n[3] https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/op-return-limits-pros-and-cons/1645/6 \r\n[4] https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/a-comprehensive-op-return-limits-q-a-resource-to-combat-misinformation/1689 \r\n[5] https://stacker.news/items/971277 \r\n[6] https://x.com/mononautical/status/1920221641948246081 \r\n[7] https://x.com/oomahq/status/1930401993341776173 \r\n[8] https://stacker.news/items/971277?commentId=971285\r\n[9] https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/addressing-community-concerns-and-objections-regarding-my-recent-proposal-to-relax-bitcoin-cores-standardness-limits-on-op-return-outputs/1697#p-5007-the-datacarrier-option-should-be-kept-on-bitcoin-core-regardless-of-whether-the-default-is-changed-26\r\n[10] https://x.com/GrassFedBitcoin/status/1921219038430015758 \r\n[11] https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/d6ZO7gXGYbQ/m/-QPhqSMwEQAJ\r\n[12] https://x.com/wk057/status/1917235710781690171 \r\n[13] https://x.com/GrassFedBitcoin/status/1921219038430015758 \r\n[14] https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/06/06/relay-statement/ \r\n[15] https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/d6ZO7gXGYbQ/m/yoSAe-aaDgAJ \r\n[16] https://bitcoinops.org/en/blog/waiting-for-confirmation/#policy-for-protection-of-node-resources \r\n[17] https://bitcoinops.org/en/blog/waiting-for-confirmation/#network-resources \r\n[18] https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/the-spam-problem-of-bitcoin-and-unpermissioned-broadcast-networks-in-general/1692/2\r\n[19] https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/d6ZO7gXGYbQ/m/GRKe8kq-EgAJ \r\n[20] https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/d6ZO7gXGYbQ/m/6PYyNG6UAQAJ \r\n[21] https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/122321/when-is-op-return-cheaper-than-op-false-op-if\r\n[22] https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/d6ZO7gXGYbQ/m/lP69f0KaAQAJ\r\n\r\nThank you to sipa for helping review this.",

The blockchain is an immutable structure that can store arbitrary data trustlessly - maybe block space is the product. and bitcoins are the tokens you can use to buy block space.  Maybe thinking of bitcoin as a pure \"currency\" in the first place was wrong, and it's actually a tool for recording information immutably in the public domain.\r\n\r\nYou can architect the blockchain to be able to store data at some rate, for some fee.  But you can't make it impossible to store data.  Even if users couldn't store arbitrary bytes, they could use an encoding based on the number of satoshis sent to themselves or something.\r\n\r\nSo really we have to figure out how best to implement data storage.  How much should users be able to store, and how expensive should it be compared with transferring bitcoins between addresses?  One constraint is that it can't be made more expensive than it would be to use some encoding based on your choice of valid transactions.",

Of course. Confirmed? Yes. But broadcasted forever by all nodes? I am not so sure about that. When nodes will stop sharing the full history from 2009, up to today, and will focus on just proving, that the system is honest, then the incentive for spamming the chain will decrease, because users will no longer see the content of their transactions, if they won't be willing to keep them locally.\r\n\r\nMany users, which make non-monetary transactions, don't care about fees. They don't care about coin amounts at all. They care only about pushing some on-chain data, sometimes even without having it protected with any public keys or signatures (which is also why Ordinals never cared about enforcing ownership properly, and why it is completely disconnected from sighashes, or other consensus-checked rules like that).\r\n\r\nWhich means, that when all transactions will be confirmed, but the effort required to retrieve data will be moved from nodes to users, then the network will be more resistant to spam. And solutions like that are possible to implement, but so far, people simply didn't produce enough spam, to make some developers angry enough, to force them to implement such rules.",

      "body": "> Sorry if this is a dumb question, but is there a threat (which this PR having removed the cap might make easier for a random actor to actualize) of someone encoding a well-recognized virus into OP_RETURN, causing malware protection on various OS versions (for example, everyone running Core on Windows) to recognize a threat, corrupt the blockchain database, and render the node defunct? I thought about trying it on testnet, but then thought twice about the legality issues if it actually were to cause the outcome that I'd be testing for.\r\n\r\nPaul raises an excellent point about the potential issues of the data that could get onto OP_RETURN. Not only the example he provides of the data could trigger a false positive in anti-virus software, but also there is the possibility of illegal data (not going to state that here obviously). But someone could put text that is illegal (in certain jurisdictions) in OP_RETURN and that data could be stored on someone's node in that jurisdiction. Obviously, this issue is going to get ignored or simply brushed off as irrelevant because the sponsors really want to get this change in regardless of any issues that might arise. However, I urge you not to discount this issue.   ",

This presents a risk for node runners as it allows anyone to store unobfuscated data on their disk.\r\n\r\nOnchain data is obfuscated by Bitcoin Core when stored on disk. Bitcoin Core only started doing so recently, and an existing block chain on disk will not be obfuscated when upgrading. Therefore old nodes may store unobfuscated `OP_RETURN` data that ends up onchain. However this is already possible at a trivial cost to an attacker: for instance as i write this post Slipstream’s feerate is 6 sats/vb so storing a 10k bytes malware file in an `OP_RETURN` would cost only ~$60 to an attacker (at $100k/BTC). Note this cost is the total cost, not just the premium. This total cost is also lower than it would have been if the attacker had to pay the past 5 years average feerate. Therefore this change does not materially affect this concern.\r\n\r\nThis change would however directly affect mempool data (which is also stored on disk) since a large `OP_RETURN` would previously not be accepted in a Bitcoin Core node’s mempool. But mempool data is now always obfuscated when stored to disk, therefore this is not an issue.",

      "body": "> Paul raises an excellent point about the potential issues of the data that could get onto OP_RETURN. Not only the example he provides of the data could trigger a false positive in anti-virus software, but also there is the possibility of illegal data (not going to state that here obviously). But someone could put text that is illegal (in certain jurisdictions) in OP_RETURN and that data could be stored on someone's node in that jurisdiction. Obviously, this issue is going to get ignored or simply brushed off as irrelevant because the sponsors really want to get this change in regardless of any issues that might arise. However, I urge you not to discount this issue.\r\n\r\nThe maintainers here don't care. I brought this up months ago and was told it was fine because the data is obfuscated now in recent versions. Apparently obfuscating illegal data on your system with an XOR key magically makes it perfectly ok to store and widely distribute! Who would have thought! (/sarcasm)\r\n\r\nThis PR is merged. Core devs clearly aren't unmerging it no matter what happens and what arguments are brought up at this point. So, I'm honestly surprised @glozow didn't just lock it at that time.",

This is largely unrelated to the \"prune\" setting, which removes *all* transaction data before its horizon.  What's left is things in the UTXO set, which -- as mentioned OP_RETURN -- content never is and never can be.\r\n\r\nWhile it's no great sin to suffer an misunderstanding, the \"lie\" accusation is both unprofessional and abusive and so if it's an accusation you made in error it would be polite to withdraw it.\r\n\r\n@wizkid057 the \"illegal data\" issue exists independently of this and isn't stopped by it and isn't stopped by the op_return limit.  Particularly, since the attack is substantially a 1/0 attack rather than a question of volume and the attacker can just mine a block or use the miner bypass apis (as darosior points out above).  It can be mitigated by encrypt in place in the sense that at least stops scanning (and thus completely answers the anti-virus point above), the legal question of its status appears to be unanswered in the US but there is a little positive evidence that the DOJ wouldn't prosecute (as they didn't prosecute freenet nodes that merely stored encrypted data with no functional access while in the process of prosecuting the parties that actually were requesting it).   Pruning, as mentioned, elimates the storage of it on pruned nodes unless the material is in an output (which it can never be for op_return).  Proposals like asstumetxo, various zkp schemes, are more complete answers but are also on a longer time horizon.\r\n\r\nThere have also been some middleground proposals which e.g. encrypt transaction data such that the user holding it *cannot* decrypt it themselves, while still not impeding sync.  But at least I've been told that some people who sought advice on the subject were told that the local encryption and lack of any interface to go dig it up is sufficient.\r\n\r\nRegardless, this is an issue which exists-- to the extent it does-- entirely independently of this pull request making this all rather off-topic.   But I thought it relevant to mention since bystanders might not be aware, as you *should* be, that the issue has been extensively considered for many years.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> The answer to all of the above is \"No.\"\r\n\r\nThe full answer is \"not yet\". People implement features, when they have enough skills to do so, or when they have no other choice. Satoshi made Bitcoin, because rules in fiat currencies made him angry enough to do that. Here, the situation is similar: nothing will be done with spam, as long as people can handle it on their machines. If nodes will start running out of resources, only then some protections will be implemented, and only by those, who will care about it. The rest of the network will use the current version, which is not resistant to spam.\r\n\r\nWhich means, that if you think, that Bitcoin will be protected globally from being spammed, then I think you are wrong. Nobody will wire that kind of code into consensus rules. Instead, people will optimize things only on their end, while keeping them compatible with the original network, and then, you will have a choice: use some implementation, which can deal with spam, or use the official one, which will process everything, and always, no matter how spammy or costly it would be.\r\n\r\nAnd then, people caring about Bitcoin being money, will naturally switch to less spammy version, because they will want to transact, and not send JPEGs to other nodes. Which means, that instead of sending \"here is your JPEG\" message, they will send \"here is a proof, that this transaction is valid\" instead, and starting a new node will be possible only if you accept that proof, because such nodes will simply ignore any requests to send plaintext version, because they won't have it (also because they don't need it to be convinced, that all consensus rules are followed).\r\n\r\n> we (as in, the network as a whole) must keep it forever in order to be able to fully validate the chain and to bootstrap others wanting to do the same\r\n\r\nStoring everything is not hard-wired into consensus rules. You have to do that, because the current implementation requires you to do so. But you can stay compatible with the current network, even if your node won't do that.",

      "body": "> They aren't just \"can be pruned\" they are _always_ pruned from the utxo set, they can't be put it it at all no matter how the node is configured, and no functionality is lost. This is largely unrelated to the \"prune\" setting, which removes _all_ transaction data before its horizon. What's left is things in the UTXO set, which -- as mentioned OP_RETURN -- content never is and never can be.\r\n> \r\n> While it's no great sin to suffer an misunderstanding, the \"lie\" accusation is both unprofessional and abusive and so if it's an accusation you made in error it would be polite to withdraw it.\r\n> \r\n> @wizkid057 the \"illegal data\" issue exists independently of this and isn't stopped by it and isn't stopped by the op_return limit. Particularly, since the attack is substantially a 1/0 attack rather than a question of volume and the attacker can just mine a block or use the miner bypass apis (as darosior points out above). It can be mitigated by encrypt in place in the sense that at least stops scanning (and thus completely answers the anti-virus point above), the legal question of its status appears to be unanswered in the US but there is a little positive evidence that the DOJ wouldn't prosecute (as they didn't prosecute freenet nodes that merely stored encrypted data with no functional access while in the process of prosecuting the parties that actually were requesting it). Pruning, as mentioned, elimates the storage of it on pruned nodes unless the material is in an output (which it can never be for op_return). Proposals like asstumetxo, various zkp schemes, are more complete answers but are also on a longer time horizon.\r\n> \r\n> There have also been some middleground proposals which e.g. encrypt transaction data such that the user holding it _cannot_ decrypt it themselves, while still not impeding sync. But at least I've been told that some people who sought advice on the subject were told that the local encryption and lack of any interface to go dig it up is sufficient.\r\n> \r\n> Regardless, this is an issue which exists-- to the extent it does-- entirely independently of this pull request making this all rather off-topic. But I thought it relevant to mention since bystanders might not be aware, as you _should_ be, that the issue has been extensively considered for many years.\r\n\r\nCompletely misses the fact that this PR lowers the barrier to entry for such garbage infinitely, but again, that doesn't seem to matter to anyone here along with any of the other adverse issues causes by this PR.\r\n\r\nStill confused as to why this thread isn't locked.",

It can be overridden with `-datacarriersize=83` to revert to the limit enforced in previous versions. Both `-datacarrier` and `-datacarriersize` options have been marked as deprecated and are expected to be removed in a future release. (#32406)\r\n> - Multiple data carrier (`OP_RETURN`) outputs in a transaction are now permitted for relay and mining. The `-datacarriersize` limit applies to the aggregate size of the scriptPubKeys across all such outputs in a transaction.  (#32406)\r\n\r\nFeel free to take or ignore as you like.",

These have an overhead of roughly 0, 1 and 2 with respect to this limit, and an overhead of 0, 1 and 10 vbytes wrt transaction weight with a corresponding impact on fees needed. If you did indeed have 83 OP_RETURN outputs, then a datacarriersize=83 limit would mean that you'd spent your entire datacarrier budget on that overhead, without actually including any data.

I think the vast majority of developers contributing to core would recommend not setting this option to a lower value than the default, so I think marking it as \"deprecated\" is reasonable, even if there are a few developers who strongly disagree.\r\n\r\nWhether (or when) the option should also be removed rather than just deprecated depends on the trade-off between how many users continue to appreciate the feature, and how much effort it is to continue to support the code, and, perhaps, whether the presence of the feature is resulting in any harmful network effects. Given currently lots of people seem to want it, and maintaining it is very low effort, leaving the option in seems obviously sensible to me. YMMV, of course. And of course, even if it does get removed from core, if users actually want it, the code is open source so they can patch it back in or use a derivative that does that for them.",

Allowing them could lead to network inconsistencies, as some nodes might not be able to properly process or relay these transactions.\r\n\r\nFull nodes must be able to process all consensus-valid transactions, or else they will fork themselves off the network. You will be glad to learn that improving network inconsistencies due to improper transaction relay is the motivation of this very PR!\r\n\r\n> Network congestion: More OP_RETURN outputs would increase transaction size, reducing the number of transactions that can be included in each block, which could lead to increased network congestion.\r\n\r\nThis is correct insomuch as the more data that is stored in OP_RETURN(s) , vs extra unspendable outputs for example, the smaller the number of bytes the witness discount is applied to in a transaction. This makes transactions storing data in OP_RETURN \"appear larger\" to the block weight calculation, therefore allowing fewer of them per block.\r\n\r\nSo whilst it does not \"increase transaction size\" vs an alternative style of data-carrying transaction (extra unspendable outputs), it does mean that fewer of them (i.e. less data) will fit in a block.\r\n\r\n> Compatibility problems: Non-standard transactions could cause compatibility issues with other nodes, wallets, and services that expect standard behavior.\r\n\r\nNon-standard transactions _are_ certainly compatible with \"other nodes and wallets\"; they are found in almost 100% of blocks today.

It can be overridden with -datacarriersize=83 to revert to the limit enforced in previous versions. The `-datacarrier` and `-datacarriersize` options have been marked as deprecated and are expected to be removed in a future release. (#32406)\r\n```",

    "body": "This change builds libraries with `-fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link` instead of `-fsanitize=fuzzer` when the cmake `-DSANITIZERS=fuzzer` option is specified. This is necessary to make fuzzing and IPC cmake options compatible with each other and avoid CI failures in #30975 which enables IPC in the fuzzer CI build:\r\n\r\nhttps://cirrus-ci.com/task/5366255504326656?logs=ci#L2817\r\nhttps://cirrus-ci.com/task/5233064575500288?logs=ci#L2384\r\n\r\nThe failures can also be reproduced by checking out #31741 and building with `cmake -B build -DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING=ON -DSANITIZERS=fuzzer -DENABLE_IPC=ON` with this fix reverted.\r\n\r\nThe fix updates the cmake build so when `-DSANITIZERS=fuzzer` is specified, the fuzz test binary is built with `-fsanitize=fuzzer` (so it can use libFuzzer's main function), and libraries are built with `-fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link` (so they can be linked into other executables with their own main functions).\r\n\r\nPreviously when `-DSANITIZERS=fuzzer` was specified, `-fsanitize=fuzzer` was applied to ALL libraries and executables. This was inappropriate because it made it impossible to build any executables other than the fuzz test executable without triggering link errors:\r\n\r\n- `` multiple definition of `main' ``\r\n- `` \"undefined reference to `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput' ``\r\n\r\nif they depended on any libraries instrumented for fuzzing.\r\n\r\nThis was especially a problem when the `ENABLE_IPC` option was set because it made building the `mpgen` code generator impossible so nothing else that depended on generated sources, including the fuzz test binary, could be built either.\r\n\r\nThis commit was previously part of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31741 and had some discussion there starting in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31741#pullrequestreview-2619682385\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28722).",

      "message": "cmake: Avoid fuzzer \"multiple definition of `main'\" errors\n\nThis change builds libraries with -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link instead of\n-fsanitize=fuzzer when the cmake -DSANITIZERS=fuzzer option is specified. This\nis necessary to make fuzzing and IPC cmake options compatible with each other\nand avoid CI failures in #30975 which enables IPC in the fuzzer CI build:\n\nhttps://cirrus-ci.com/task/5366255504326656?logs=ci#L2817\nhttps://cirrus-ci.com/task/5233064575500288?logs=ci#L2384\n\nThe failures can also be reproduced by checking out #31741 and building with\n`cmake -B build -DBUILD_FOR_FUZZING=ON -DSANITIZERS=fuzzer -DENABLE_IPC=ON`\nwith this fix reverted.\n\nThe fix updates the cmake build so when -DSANITIZERS=fuzzer is specified, the\nfuzz test binary is built with -fsanitize=fuzzer (so it can use libFuzzer's\nmain function), and libraries are built with -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link (so they\ncan be linked into other executables with their own main functions).\n\nPreviously when -DSANITIZERS=fuzzer was specified, -fsanitize=fuzzer was\napplied to ALL libraries and executables. This was inappropriate because it\nmade it impossible to build any executables other than the fuzz test executable\nwithout triggering link errors:\n\n- \"multiple definition of `main'\"\n- \"undefined reference to `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput'\"\n\nif they depended on any libraries instrumented for fuzzing.\n\nThis was especially a problem when the ENABLE_IPC option was set because it\nmade building the mpgen code generator impossible so nothing else that depended\non generated sources, including the fuzz test binary, could be built either.\n\nThis commit was previously part of\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31741 and had some discussion there\nstarting in\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31741#pullrequestreview-2619682385",

It's not used/tested by our fuzzing harnesses.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this PR isn't enabling IPC in the fuzzing CI configuration, just fixing a more general build system bug which causes that configuration to be broken. But a followup PR #30975 does enable IPC in the fuzzing CI configuration for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- To test ENABLE_IPC option in different scenarios and uncover incompatibilities like this\r\n- To make the fuzz configuration more similar to an eventual default configuration, since a goal after #31741 is to enable ipc by default.\r\n- To make it possible to write fuzz tests covering IPC serialization code. This could involve writing new tests or just changing setup of existing tests. For example with #29409, [`FuzzedWallet`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8cb6ab0b971a27ba255ad6a48959a8c7b84c00f3/src/test/fuzz/util/wallet.h#L23) could be passed an IPC chain interface instead of a local one.",

I didn't notice the FUZZ_LIBS variable, but logically it also makes sense for that to be part of the `fuzzer_interface` target not `core_interface` target. Latest push should move it, though even without this change I think the oss-fuzz build would be ok since it is [not enabling ipc](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/ceb9cf607fbfd9def9ec706b748879d4d493a7e4/projects/bitcoin-core/build.sh#L68-L75) \r\n\r\n> Could we instead opt to not build `mpgen` with any instrumentation? Iiuc we're not interested in fuzzing `mpgen` itself.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible, but there would be complications because mpgen depends on a the libmultiprocess library which should be built with fuzzing options and should possible to fuzz. A workaround like building two copies of the library with and without fuzzing options would would be technically possible, but I don't see a reason to implement a workaround like this. I think an approach where the build provides a `fuzzer_interface` target to contain fuzz linker flags is strictly better than adding fuzz linker flags to the `core_interface` target where they will be applied to all binaries including ones that are not fuzz tests.",

I can try to implement your suggested changes but since they are all about code style, maybe it would be faster if you could just post a diff with your preferred change and I can apply it? I could try to figure out how to integrate your suggestions, but since they go against my own preferences for having fewer variables and not repeating code I think it would be harder for me to figure out what you want than for you to just implement what you want.",
